# smalldatetime (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricsqldb](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

Defines a date that is combined with a time of day. The time is based on a 24-hour day, with seconds always zero (`:00`) and without fractional seconds.

> [!NOTE]  
> Use the **time**, **date**, **datetime2**, and **datetimeoffset** data types for new work. These types align with the SQL standard, as they're more portable. **time**, **datetime2** and **datetimeoffset** provide more seconds precision. **datetimeoffset** provides time zone support for globally deployed applications.

## ANSI and ISO 8601 compliance

**smalldatetime** isn't ANSI or ISO 8601 compliant.

## Convert date and time data

When you convert to date and time data types, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] rejects all values it can't recognize as dates or times. For information about using the `CAST` and `CONVERT` functions with date and time data, see [CAST and CONVERT](../../t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql.md).

### Convert smalldatetime to other date and time types

This section describes what occurs when a **smalldatetime** data type is converted to other date and time data types.

For a conversion to **date**, the year, month, and day are copied. The following code shows the results of converting a **smalldatetime** value to a **date** value.

```sql
DECLARE @smalldatetime AS SMALLDATETIME = '1955-12-13 12:43:10';

DECLARE @date AS DATE = @smalldatetime;

SELECT @smalldatetime AS '@smalldatetime',
       @date AS 'date';
```

[!INCLUDE [ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
@smalldatetime        date
--------------------- ----------
1955-12-13 12:43:00   1955-12-13
```

When the conversion is to **time(*n*)**, the hours, minutes, and seconds are copied. The fractional seconds are set to `0`. The following code shows the results of converting a **smalldatetime** value to a **time(4)** value.

```sql
DECLARE @smalldatetime AS SMALLDATETIME = '1955-12-13 12:43:10';

DECLARE @time AS TIME (4) = @smalldatetime;

SELECT @smalldatetime AS '@smalldatetime',
       @time AS 'time';
```

[!INCLUDE [ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
@smalldatetime          time
----------------------- -------------
1955-12-13 12:43:00     12:43:00.0000
```

When the conversion is to **datetime**, the **smalldatetime** value is copied to the **datetime** value. The fractional seconds are set to `0`. The following code shows the results of converting a **smalldatetime** value to a **datetime** value.

```sql
DECLARE @smalldatetime AS SMALLDATETIME = '1955-12-13 12:43:10';

DECLARE @datetime AS DATETIME = @smalldatetime;

SELECT @smalldatetime AS '@smalldatetime',
       @datetime AS 'datetime';
```

[!INCLUDE [ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
@smalldatetime          datetime
----------------------- -----------------------
1955-12-13 12:43:00     1955-12-13 12:43:00.000
```

For a conversion to **datetimeoffset(*n*)**, the **smalldatetime** value is copied to the **datetimeoffset(*n*)** value. The fractional seconds are set to `0`, and the time zone offset is set to `+00:0`. The following code shows the results of converting a **smalldatetime** value to a **datetimeoffset(4)** value.

```sql
DECLARE @smalldatetime AS SMALLDATETIME = '1955-12-13 12:43:10';

DECLARE @datetimeoffset AS DATETIMEOFFSET (4) = @smalldatetime;

SELECT @smalldatetime AS '@smalldatetime',
       @datetimeoffset AS 'datetimeoffset(4)';
```

[!INCLUDE [ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
@smalldatetime        datetimeoffset(4)
--------------------- ------------------------------
1955-12-13 12:43:00   1955-12-13 12:43:00.0000 +00:0
```

For the conversion to **datetime2(n)**, the **smalldatetime** value is copied to the **datetime2(n)** value. The fractional seconds are set to `0`. The following code shows the results of converting a **smalldatetime** value to a **datetime2(4)** value.

```sql
DECLARE @smalldatetime AS SMALLDATETIME = '1955-12-13 12:43:10';

DECLARE @datetime2 AS DATETIME2 (4) = @smalldatetime;

SELECT @smalldatetime AS '@smalldatetime',
       @datetime2 AS ' datetime2(4)';
```

[!INCLUDE [ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
@smalldatetime        datetime2(4)
--------------------- ------------------------
1955-12-13 12:43:00   1955-12-13 12:43:00.0000
```

## Examples

### A. Cast string literals with seconds to smalldatetime

The following example compares the conversion of seconds in string literals to **smalldatetime**.

```sql
SELECT CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29' AS SMALLDATETIME),
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:30' AS SMALLDATETIME),
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:59:59.998' AS SMALLDATETIME);
```

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `2024-05-08 12:35:29` | `2024-05-08 12:35:00` |
| `2024-05-08 12:35:30` | `2024-05-08 12:36:00` |
| `2024-05-08 12:59:59.998` | `2024-05-08 13:00:00` |

### B. Compare date and time data types

The following example compares the results of casting a string to each date and time data type.

```sql
SELECT CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29.1234567 +12:15' AS TIME (7)) AS 'time',
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29.1234567 +12:15' AS DATE) AS 'date',
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29.123' AS SMALLDATETIME) AS 'smalldatetime',
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29.123' AS DATETIME) AS 'datetime',
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29.1234567 +12:15' AS DATETIME2 (7)) AS 'datetime2',
       CAST ('2024-05-08 12:35:29.1234567 +12:15' AS DATETIMEOFFSET (7)) AS 'datetimeoffset';
```

| Data type | Output |
| --- | --- |
| **time** | `12:35:29.1234567` |
| **date** | `2024-05-08` |
| **smalldatetime** | `2024-05-08 12:35:00` |
| **datetime** | `2024-05-08 12:35:29.123` |
| **datetime2** | `2024-05-08 12:35:29.1234567` |
| **datetimeoffset** | `2024-05-08 12:35:29.1234567 +12:15` |
