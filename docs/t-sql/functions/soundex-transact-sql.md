# SOUNDEX (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Returns a four-character (`SOUNDEX`) code to evaluate the similarity of two strings.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
SOUNDEX ( character_expression )
```

## Arguments

#### *character_expression*

An alphanumeric [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of character data. *character_expression* can be a constant, variable, or column.

## Return types

**varchar**

## Remarks

`SOUNDEX` converts an alphanumeric string to a four-character code that is based on how the string sounds when spoken in English. The first character of the code is the first character of *character_expression*, converted to upper case. The second through fourth characters of the code are numbers that represent the letters in the expression. The letters `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `U`, `H`, `W`, and `Y` are ignored unless they're the first letter of the string. Zeroes are added at the end if necessary to produce a four-character code. For more information about the `SOUNDEX` code, see [The Soundex Indexing System](https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html).

`SOUNDEX` codes from different strings can be compared to see how similar the strings sound when spoken. The [DIFFERENCE()](difference-transact-sql.md) function performs a `SOUNDEX` on two strings, and returns an integer that represents how similar the `SOUNDEX` codes are for those strings.

`SOUNDEX` is collation sensitive. String functions can be nested.

## SOUNDEX compatibility

In previous versions of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the `SOUNDEX` function applied a subset of the `SOUNDEX` rules. Under database compatibility level 110 or higher, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] applies a more complete set of the rules.

After upgrading to compatibility level 110 or higher, you might need to rebuild the indexes, heaps, or `CHECK` constraints that use the `SOUNDEX` function.

- A heap that contains a persisted computed column defined with `SOUNDEX` can't be queried until the heap is rebuilt by running the following statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE <table> REBUILD;
  ```

- `CHECK` constraints defined with `SOUNDEX` are disabled upon upgrade. To enable the constraint, run the following statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE <table> WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
  ```

- Indexes (including indexed views) that contain a persisted computed column defined with `SOUNDEX` can't be queried until the index is rebuilt by running the following statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER INDEX ALL ON <object> REBUILD;
  ```

## Examples

### A. Use SOUNDEX

The following example shows the `SOUNDEX` function and the related `DIFFERENCE` function. In the first example, the standard `SOUNDEX` values are returned for all consonants. Returning the `SOUNDEX` for `Smith` and `Smythe` returns the same `SOUNDEX` result because all vowels, the letter `y`, doubled letters, and the letter `h`, aren't included.

```sql
SELECT SOUNDEX('Smith'),
       SOUNDEX('Smythe');
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)] Valid for a `Latin1_General` collation.

```output
S530  S530
```

### B. Use DIFFERENCE

The `DIFFERENCE` function compares the difference of the `SOUNDEX` pattern results. The following example shows two strings that differ only in vowels. The difference returned is `4`, the lowest possible difference.

```sql
SELECT DIFFERENCE('Smithers', 'Smythers');
GO
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)] Valid for a `Latin1_General` collation.

```output
4
```

In the following example, the strings differ in consonants; therefore, the difference returned is `2`, the greater difference.

```sql
SELECT DIFFERENCE('Anothers', 'Brothers');
GO
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)] Valid for a `Latin1_General` collation.

```output
2
```
