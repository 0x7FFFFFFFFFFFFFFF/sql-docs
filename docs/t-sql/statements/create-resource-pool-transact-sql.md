# CREATE RESOURCE POOL (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Creates a [resource governor](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor.md) resource pool. A resource pool represents a subset of the physical resources (CPU, memory, and IO) of a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] instance. Resource governor enables you to reserve or limit server resources among resource pools, up to a maximum of 64 pools.

Resource governor isn't available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2022](~/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure SQL Managed Instance, you must be in the context of the `master` database to modify resource governor configuration.

CREATE RESOURCE POOL pool_name
[ WITH
    (
        [ MIN_CPU_PERCENT = value ]
        [ [ , ] MAX_CPU_PERCENT = value ]
        [ [ , ] CAP_CPU_PERCENT = value ]
        [ [ , ] AFFINITY {SCHEDULER =
                  AUTO
                | ( <scheduler_range_spec> )
                | NUMANODE = ( <NUMA_node_range_spec> )
                } ]
        [ [ , ] MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT = value ]
        [ [ , ] MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = value ]
        [ [ , ] MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = value ]
        [ [ , ] MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = value ]
    )
]
[;]

<scheduler_range_spec> ::=
{ SCHED_ID | SCHED_ID TO SCHED_ID }[,...n]

<NUMA_node_range_spec> ::=
{ NUMA_node_ID | NUMA_node_ID TO NUMA_node_ID }[,...n]
```

## Arguments

#### *pool_name*

Is the user-defined name for the resource pool. *pool_name* is alphanumeric, can be up to 128 characters, must be unique within a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] instance, and must comply with the rules for [Database identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).

#### MIN_CPU_PERCENT = *value*

Specifies the guaranteed average CPU bandwidth for all requests in the resource pool when there is CPU contention. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 0. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 100.

#### MAX_CPU_PERCENT = *value*

Specifies the maximum average CPU bandwidth that all requests in resource pool receive when there is CPU contention. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.

#### CAP_CPU_PERCENT = *value*

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.

Specifies a hard cap on the CPU bandwidth that all requests in the resource pool receive. Limits the maximum CPU bandwidth level to be the same as the specified value. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.

> [!NOTE]
>  Due to the statistical nature of CPU governance, you might notice occasional short spikes exceeding the value specified in `CAP_CPU_PERCENT`.

#### AFFINITY {SCHEDULER = AUTO | ( <scheduler_range_spec> ) | NUMANODE = (<NUMA_node_range_spec>)}

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.

Attach the resource pool to specific schedulers. The default value is `AUTO`.

Specifying `<scheduler_range_spec>` for `AFFINITY SCHEDULER` affinitizes the resource pool to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] schedulers identified by the given IDs. These IDs map to the values in the `scheduler_id` column in [sys.dm_os_schedulers](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-schedulers-transact-sql.md).

Specifying `<NUMA_node_range_spec>` for `AFFINITY NUMANODE` affinitizes the resource pool to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] schedulers that map to the logical CPUs that correspond to the given NUMA node or a range of nodes. You can use the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query to discover the mapping between the physical NUMA configuration and the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] scheduler IDs.

```sql
SELECT osn.memory_node_id AS numa_node_id,
       sc.cpu_id,
       sc.scheduler_id
FROM sys.dm_os_nodes AS osn
INNER JOIN sys.dm_os_schedulers AS sc
ON osn.node_id = sc.parent_node_id
   AND
   sc.scheduler_id < 1048576;
```

#### MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT = *value*

Specifies the minimum amount of query workspace memory reserved for the resource pool that can't be shared with other resource pools. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 0. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 to 100.

#### MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = *value*

Specifies the maximum amount of query workspace memory that requests in this resource pool can use. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.

#### MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = *value*

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later.

Specifies the minimum I/O operations per second (IOPS) per disk volume to reserve for the resource pool. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647). Specify 0 to indicate no minimum for the pool. The default is 0.

#### MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = *value*

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later.

Specifies the maximum I/O operations per second (IOPS) per disk volume to allow for the resource pool. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647). Specify 0 to remove an IOPS limit for the pool. The default is 0.

If the `MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` for a pool is set to 0, the pool isn't IO-governed at all and can take all the IOPS in the system even if other pools have `MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` set. For this case, we recommend that you set the `MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` value for this pool to a high number (for example, the maximum value 2^31-1) to make this pool IO-governed and to honor the IOPS reservations that might exist for other pools.

## Remarks

The sum of `MIN_CPU_PERCENT` or `MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT` for all resource pools can't exceed 100 percent.

`MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` and `MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` specify the minimum and maximum IOs per second. The IOs can be either reads or writes, and can be of any size. Therefore, with the same IOPS limits, the minimum and maximum IO throughput can vary depending on the mix of IO sizes in the workload.

The values for `MAX_CPU_PERCENT` and `MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT` must be greater than or equal to the values for `MIN_CPU_PERCENT` and `MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT`, respectively.

`CAP_CPU_PERCENT` differs from `MAX_CPU_PERCENT` in that workloads associated with the pool can use CPU capacity above the value of `MAX_CPU_PERCENT` if it is available, but not above the value of `CAP_CPU_PERCENT`. Although there might be short spikes higher than `CAP_CPU_PERCENT`, workloads can't exceed `CAP_CPU_PERCENT` for extended periods of time, even when additional CPU capacity is available.

The total CPU percentage for each affinitized component (scheduler(s) or NUMA node(s)) can't exceed 100 percent.

## Permissions

Requires the `CONTROL SERVER` permission.

## Examples

For additional resource governor configuration examples, see [Resource governor configuration examples and best practices](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-walkthrough.md).

### Create a resource pool

This example created a resource pool named `bigPool`. This pool uses the default resource governor settings.

```sql
CREATE RESOURCE POOL bigPool;
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
```

### Set CPU and memory reservations and limits

This example configures the `adhocPool` resource pool as follows:
- Reserves 10 percent of CPU and 5 percent of query workspace memory using `MIN_CPU_PERCENT` and `MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT` respectively.
- Sets a 15 percent query workspace memory limit using `MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT`.
- Sets a 20 percent soft CPU cap a 30 percent hard CPU cap using `MAX_CPU_PERCENT` and `CAP_CPU_PERCENT` respectively.
- Affinitizes the pool to two ranges of logical CPUs (0 to 63 and 128 to 191) using `AFFINITY SCHEDULER`.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.

```sql
CREATE RESOURCE POOL adhocPool
WITH (
     MIN_CPU_PERCENT = 10,
     MAX_CPU_PERCENT = 20,
     CAP_CPU_PERCENT = 30,
     MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT = 5,
     MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 15,
     AFFINITY SCHEDULER = (0 TO 63, 128 TO 191)
     );
```

### Set IOPS reservation and limit

This example reserves 200 IOPS per volume for the pool using `MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME`, and limits the IOPS per volume to 1000 using `MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME`. These values govern the total physical I/O read and write operations that are available for requests using the resource pool.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later.

```sql
CREATE RESOURCE POOL PoolAdmin
WITH (
     MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 200,
     MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 1000
     );
```
