# SHUTDOWN (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Immediately stops SQL Server.

:::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
SHUTDOWN [ WITH NOWAIT ]
```

## Arguments

#### WITH NOWAIT

Optional. Shuts down [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] without performing checkpoints in every database. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] exits after attempting to terminate all user processes. When the server restarts, a rollback operation occurs for incomplete transactions.

## Remarks

Unless the `WITH NOWAIT` option is used, `SHUTDOWN` shuts down [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by:

1. Disabling logins (except for members of the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles).

   > [!NOTE]  
   > To display a list of all current users, run `sp_who`.

1. Waiting for currently running Transact-SQL statements or stored procedures to finish. To display a list of all active processes and locks, run `sp_who` and `sp_lock`, respectively.

1. Inserting a checkpoint in every database.

Using the `SHUTDOWN` statement minimizes the amount of automatic recovery work needed when members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role restart [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

Other tools and methods can also be used to stop [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Each of these issues a checkpoint in all databases. You can flush committed data from the data cache and stop the server:

- By using [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager.

- By running `net stop mssqlserver` from a command prompt for a default instance, or by running `net stop mssql$<instancename>` from a command prompt for a named instance.

- By using Services in Control Panel.

If `sqlservr.exe` was started from the command prompt, pressing **Ctrl**+**C** shuts down [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. However, pressing **Ctrl**+**C** doesn't insert a checkpoint.

> [!NOTE]  
> Using any of these methods to stop [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] sends the `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP` message to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

## Permissions

`SHUTDOWN` permissions are assigned to members of the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles, and they aren't transferable.
