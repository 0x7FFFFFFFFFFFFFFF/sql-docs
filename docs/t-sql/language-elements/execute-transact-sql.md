# EXECUTE (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

Executes a command string or character string within a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] batch, or one of the following modules: system stored procedure, user-defined stored procedure, CLR stored procedure, scalar-valued user-defined function, or extended stored procedure. The `EXEC` or `EXECUTE` statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. Additionally, the context in which a string or command is executed can be explicitly set. Metadata for the result set can be defined by using the `WITH RESULT SETS` options.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you call `EXECUTE` with a character string, validate the character string. Never execute a command constructed from user input that hasn't been validated.

## Arguments

#### *@return_status*

An optional integer variable that stores the return status of a module. This variable must be declared in the batch, stored procedure, or function before it's used in an `EXECUTE` statement.

When used to invoke a scalar-valued user-defined function, the *@return_status* variable can be of any scalar data type.

#### *module_name*

The fully qualified or nonfully qualified name of the stored procedure or scalar-valued user-defined function to call. Module names must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md). The names of extended stored procedures are always case-sensitive, regardless of the collation of the server.

A module that was created in another database can be executed if the user running the module owns the module, or has the appropriate permission to execute it in that database. A module can be executed on another server running [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] if the user running the module has the appropriate permission to use that server (remote access) and to execute the module in that database. If a server name is specified but no database name is specified, the [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] looks for the module in the default database of the user.

#### ;*number*

An optional integer that is used to group procedures of the same name. This parameter isn't used for extended stored procedures.

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)]

For more information about procedure groups, see [CREATE PROCEDURE](../statements/create-procedure-transact-sql.md).

#### *@module_name_var*

The name of a locally defined variable that represents a module name.

This can be a variable that holds the name of a natively compiled, scalar user-defined function.

#### *@parameter*

The parameter for *module_name*, as defined in the module. Parameter names must be preceded by the at sign (`@`). When used with the *@parameter_name* = *value* form, parameter names and constants don't have to be supplied in the order in which they're defined in the module. However, if the *@parameter_name* = *value* form is used for any parameter, it must be used for all subsequent parameters.

By default, parameters are nullable.

#### *value*

The value of the parameter to pass to the module or pass-through command. If parameter names aren't specified, parameter values must be supplied in the order defined in the module.

When executing pass-through commands against linked servers, the order of the parameter values depends on the OLE DB provider of the linked server. Most OLE DB providers bind values to parameters from left to right.

If the value of a parameter is an object name, character string, or qualified by a database name or schema name, the whole name must be enclosed in single quotation marks. If the value of a parameter is a keyword, the keyword must be enclosed in double quotation marks.

If you pass a single word that doesn't begin with `@`, that isn't enclosed in quotation marks (for example, if you forget `@` on a parameter name), the word is treated as an **nvarchar** string, in spite of the missing quotation marks.

If a default is defined in the module, a user can execute the module without specifying a parameter.

The default can also be `NULL`. Generally, the module definition specifies the action that should be taken if a parameter value is `NULL`.

#### *@variable*

The variable that stores a parameter or a return parameter.

#### OUTPUT

Specifies that the module or command string returns a parameter. The matching parameter in the module or command string must also have been created by using the keyword `OUTPUT`. Use this keyword when you use cursor variables as parameters.

If *value* is defined as `OUTPUT` of a module executed against a linked server, any changes to the corresponding *@parameter* performed by the OLE DB provider are copied back to the variable at the end of the execution of module.

If `OUTPUT` parameters are being used and the intent is to use the return values in other statements within the calling batch or module, the value of the parameter must be passed as a variable, such as *@parameter* = *@variable*. You can't execute a module by specifying `OUTPUT` for a parameter that isn't defined as an `OUTPUT` parameter in the module. Constants can't be passed to module by using `OUTPUT`; the return parameter requires a variable name. The data type of the variable must be declared and a value assigned before executing the procedure.

When `EXECUTE` is used against a remote stored procedure, or to execute a pass-through command against a linked server, `OUTPUT` parameters can't be any one of the large object (LOB) data types.

Return parameters can be of any data type except the LOB data types.

#### DEFAULT

Supplies the default value of the parameter as defined in the module. When the module expects a value for a parameter that doesn't have a defined default and either a parameter is missing or the `DEFAULT` keyword is specified, an error occurs.

#### *@string_variable*

The name of a local variable. *@string_variable* can be any **char**, **varchar**, **nchar**, or **nvarchar** data type. These include the **(max)** data types.

#### [N]'*tsql_string*'

A constant string. *tsql_string* can be any **nvarchar** or **varchar** data type. If the `N` is included, the string is interpreted as **nvarchar** data type.

#### AS *context_specification*

Specifies the context in which the statement is executed.

#### LOGIN

Specifies the context to be impersonated is a login. The scope of impersonation is the server.

#### USER

Specifies the context to be impersonated is a user in the current database. The scope of impersonation is restricted to the current database. A context switch to a database user doesn't inherit the server-level permissions of that user.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While the context switch to the database user is active, any attempt to access resources outside the database causes the statement to fail. This includes `USE <database>` statements, distributed queries, and queries that reference another database by using three-part or four-part identifiers.

#### '*name*'

A valid user or login name. The *name* argument must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or exist as a principal in [sys.database_principals](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-database-principals-transact-sql.md) or [sys.server_principals](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-server-principals-transact-sql.md), respectively.

This argument can't be a built-in account, such as `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService`, `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`, or `NT AUTHORITY\LocalSystem`.

For more information, see [Specifying a User or Login Name](#_user) later in this article.

#### [N]'*command_string*'

A constant string that contains the command to be passed through to the linked server. If the `N` is included, the string is interpreted as **nvarchar** data type.

#### [?]

Indicates parameters for which values are supplied in the `<arg-list>` of pass-through commands that are used in an `EXECUTE ('...', <arg-list>) AT <linkedsrv>` statement.

#### AT *linked_server_name*

Specifies that *command_string* is executed against *linked_server_name* and results, if any, are returned to the client. *linked_server_name* must refer to an existing linked server definition in the local server. Linked servers are defined by using [sp_addlinkedserver](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addlinkedserver-transact-sql.md).

- `WITH <execute_option>`

  Possible execute options. The `RESULT SETS` options can't be specified in an `INSERT...EXECUTE` statement.

#### AT DATA_SOURCE *data_source_name*

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later versions.

Specifies that *command_string* is executed against *data_source_name* and results, if any, are returned to the client. *data_source_name* must refer to an existing `EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE` definition in the database. Only data sources that point to SQL Server are supported. Additionally, for SQL Server Big Data Cluster data sources that point to compute pool, data pool or storage pool are supported. Data sources are defined by using [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).

- `WITH <execute_option>`

  Possible execute options. The `RESULT SETS` options can't be specified in an `INSERT...EXECUTE` statement.

  | Term | Definition |
  | --- | --- |
  | `RECOMPILE` | Forces a new plan to be compiled, used, and discarded after the module is executed. If there's an existing query plan for the module, this plan remains in the cache.<br /><br />Use this option if the parameter you're supplying is atypical or if the data has significantly changed. This option isn't used for extended stored procedures. We recommend that you use this option sparingly because it's expensive.<br /><br />**Note:** You can't use `WITH RECOMPILE` when calling a stored procedure that uses `OPENDATASOURCE` syntax. The `WITH RECOMPILE` option is ignored when a four-part object name is specified.<br /><br />**Note:** `RECOMPILE` isn't supported with natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions. If you need to recompile, use [sp_recompile](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-recompile-transact-sql.md). |
  | `RESULT SETS UNDEFINED` | This option provides no guarantee of what results, if any, are returned, and no definition is provided. The statement executes without error if any results are returned or no results are returned. `RESULT SETS UNDEFINED` is the default behavior if a result_sets_option isn't provided.<br /><br />For interpreted scalar user-defined functions, and natively compiled scalar user-defined functions, this option isn't operational because the functions never return a result set.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. |
  | `RESULT SETS NONE` | Guarantees that the `EXECUTE` statement doesn't return any results. If any results are returned the batch is aborted.<br /><br />For interpreted scalar user-defined functions, and natively compiled scalar user-defined functions, this option isn't operational because the functions never return a result set.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. |
  | `<result_sets_definition>` | Provides a guarantee that the result comes back as specified in the `result_sets_definition`. For statements that return multiple result sets, provide multiple *result_sets_definition* sections. Enclose each *result_sets_definition* in parentheses, separated by commas. For more information, see `<result_sets_definition>` later in this article.<br /><br />This option always results in an error for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions because the functions never return a result set.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. |

  `<result_sets_definition>` describes the result sets returned by the executed statements. The clauses of the `result_sets_definition` have the following meaning:

  | Term | Definition |
  | --- | --- |
  | { column_name data_type <br />[ COLLATE collation_name ]<br />[NULL &#124; NOT NULL] } | See the following table. |
  | db_name | The name of the database containing the table, view, or table valued function. |
  | schema_name | The name of the schema owning the table, view, or table valued function. |
  | table_name &#124; view_name &#124; table_valued_function_name | Specifies that the columns returned are those specified in the table, view, or table valued function named. Table variables, temporary tables, and synonyms aren't supported in the AS object syntax. |
  | AS TYPE [ schema_name. ]table_type_name | Specifies that the columns returned are those specified in the table type. |
  | AS FOR XML | Specifies that the XML results from the statement or stored procedure called by the `EXECUTE` statement are converted into the format as though they were produced by a `SELECT ... FOR XML ...` statement. All formatting from the type directives in the original statement is removed, and the results returned are as though no type directive was specified. AS FOR XML doesn't convert non-XML tabular results from the executed statement or stored procedure into XML. |  

  | Term | Definition |
  | --- | --- |
  | column_name | The names of each column. If the number of columns differs from the result set, an error occurs and the batch is aborted. If the name of a column differs from the result set, the column name returned will be set to the name defined. |
  | data_type | The data types of each column. If the data types differ, an implicit conversion to the defined data type is performed. If the conversion fails the batch is aborted |
  | COLLATE collation_name | The collation of each column. If there's a collation mismatch, an implicit collation is attempted. If that fails, the batch is aborted. |
  | NULL &#124; NOT NULL | The nullability of each column. If the defined nullability is `NOT NULL` and the data returned contains nulls, an error occurs and the batch is aborted. If not specified, the default value conforms to the setting of the `ANSI_NULL_DFLT_ON` and `ANSI_NULL_DFLT_OFF` options. |  

  The actual result set being returned during execution can differ from the result defined using the `WITH RESULT SETS` clause in one of the following ways: number of result sets, number of columns, column name, nullability, and data type. If the number of result sets differs, an error occurs and the batch is aborted.

## Remarks

Parameters can be supplied either by using *value* or by using *@parameter_name* = *value*. A parameter isn't part of a transaction; therefore, if a parameter is changed in a transaction that is later rolled back, the value of the parameter doesn't revert to its previous value. The value returned to the caller is always the value at the time the module returns.

Nesting occurs when one module calls another or executes managed code by referencing a common language runtime (CLR) module, user-defined type, or aggregate. The nesting level increments when the called module or managed code reference starts execution, and decrements when the called module or managed code reference finishes. Exceeding the maximum of 32 nesting levels causes the complete calling chain to fail. The current nesting level is stored in the `@@NESTLEVEL` system function.

Because remote stored procedures and extended stored procedures aren't within the scope of a transaction (unless issued within a `BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION` statement or when used with various configuration options), commands executed through calls to them can't be rolled back. For more information, see [System stored procedures](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/system-stored-procedures-transact-sql.md) and [BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION](begin-distributed-transaction-transact-sql.md).

When you use cursor variables, if you execute a procedure that passes in a cursor variable with a cursor allocated to it, an error occurs.

You don't have to specify the `EXECUTE` keyword when executing modules if the statement is the first one in a batch.

For more information specific to CLR stored procedures, see [CLR Stored Procedures](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/clr-stored-procedures).

## Use EXECUTE with stored procedures

You don't have to specify the `EXECUTE` keyword when you execute stored procedures when the statement is the first one in a batch.

[!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system stored procedures start with the characters `sp_`. They are physically stored in the [Resource Database](../../relational-databases/databases/resource-database.md), but logically appear in the sys schema of every system and user-defined database. When you execute a system stored procedure, either in a batch or inside a module such as a user-defined stored procedure or function, we recommend that you qualify the stored procedure name with the sys schema name.

[!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system extended stored procedures start with the characters `xp_`, and these are contained in the dbo schema of the `master` database. When you execute a system extended stored procedure, either in a batch or inside a module such as a user-defined stored procedure or function, we recommend that you qualify the stored procedure name with `master.dbo`.

When you execute a user-defined stored procedure, either in a batch or inside a module such as a user-defined stored procedure or function, we recommend that you qualify the stored procedure name with a schema name. We don't recommend that you name a user-defined stored procedure with the same name as a system stored procedure. For more information about executing stored procedures, see [Execute a stored procedure](../../relational-databases/stored-procedures/execute-a-stored-procedure.md).

## Use EXECUTE with a character string

In [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the **varchar(max)** and **nvarchar(max)** data types can be specified that allow for character strings to be up to 2 gigabytes of data.

Changes in database context last only until the end of the `EXECUTE` statement. For example, after the `EXECUTE` in this following statement is run, the database context is `master`.

```sql
USE master;

EXECUTE ('USE AdventureWorks2022; SELECT BusinessEntityID, JobTitle FROM HumanResources.Employee;');
```

## Context switching

You can use the `AS { LOGIN | USER } = '<name>'` clause to switch the execution context of a dynamic statement. When the context switch is specified as `EXECUTE ('string') AS <context_specification>`, the duration of the context switch is limited to the scope of the query being executed.

<a id="_user"></a>

### Specify a user or login name

The user or login name specified in `AS { LOGIN | USER } = '<name>'` must exist as a principal in `sys.database_principals` or `sys.server_principals` respectively, or the statement fails. Additionally, `IMPERSONATE` permissions must be granted on the principal. Unless the caller is the database owner or is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, the principal must exist even when the user is accessing the database or instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] through a Windows group membership. For example, assume the following conditions:

- `CompanyDomain\SQLUsers` group has access to the `Sales` database.

- `CompanyDomain\SqlUser1` is a member of `SQLUsers` and, therefore, has implicit access to the `Sales` database.

Although `CompanyDomain\SqlUser1` has access to the database through membership in the `SQLUsers` group, the statement `EXECUTE @string_variable AS USER = 'CompanyDomain\SqlUser1'` fails because `CompanyDomain\SqlUser1` doesn't exist as a principal in the database.

### Best practices

Specify a login or user that has the least privileges required to perform the operations that are defined in the statement or module. For example, don't specify a login name, which has server-level permissions, if only database-level permissions are required. Or, don't specify a database owner account unless those permissions are required.

## Permissions

Permissions aren't required to run the `EXECUTE` statement. However, permissions are required on the securables that are referenced within the `EXECUTE` string. For example, if the string contains an `INSERT` statement, the caller of the `EXECUTE` statement must have `INSERT` permission on the target table. Permissions are checked at the time `EXECUTE` statement is encountered, even if the `EXECUTE` statement is included within a module.

`EXECUTE` permissions for a module default to the owner of the module, who can transfer them to other users. When a module is run that executes a string, permissions are checked in the context of the user who executes the module, not in the context of the user who created the module. However, if the same user owns the calling module and the module being called, `EXECUTE` permission checking isn't performed for the second module.

If the module accesses other database objects, execution succeeds when you have `EXECUTE` permission on the module and one of the following conditions is true:

- The module is marked `EXECUTE AS USER` or `EXECUTE AS SELF`, and the module owner has the corresponding permissions on the referenced object. For more information about impersonation within a module, see [EXECUTE AS clause](../statements/execute-as-clause-transact-sql.md).

- The module is marked `EXECUTE AS CALLER`, and you have the corresponding permissions on the object.

- The module is marked `EXECUTE AS <user_name>`, and `<user_name>` has the corresponding permissions on the object.

### Context switching permissions

To specify `EXECUTE AS` on a login, the caller must have `IMPERSONATE` permissions on the specified login name. To specify `EXECUTE AS` on a database user, the caller must have `IMPERSONATE` permissions on the specified user name. When no execution context is specified, or `EXECUTE AS CALLER` is specified, `IMPERSONATE` permissions aren't required.

## Examples: SQL Server

[!INCLUDE [article-uses-adventureworks](../../includes/article-uses-adventureworks.md)]

### A. Use EXECUTE to pass a single parameter

The `uspGetEmployeeManagers` stored procedure in the [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database expects one parameter (`@EmployeeID`). The following examples execute the `uspGetEmployeeManagers` stored procedure with `Employee ID 6` as its parameter value.

```sql
EXECUTE dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers 6;
GO
```

The variable can be explicitly named in the execution:

```sql
EXECUTE dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers @EmployeeID = 6;
GO
```

If the following is the first statement in a batch or a **sqlcmd** script, `EXECUTE` isn't required.

```sql
dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers 6;
GO

--Or
dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers @EmployeeID = 6;
GO
```

### B. Use multiple parameters

The following example executes the `spGetWhereUsedProductID` stored procedure in the [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database. It passes two parameters: the first parameter is a product ID (`819`) and the second parameter, `@CheckDate,` is a `datetime` value.

```sql
DECLARE @CheckDate AS DATETIME;
SET @CheckDate = GETDATE();

EXECUTE dbo.uspGetWhereUsedProductID 819, @CheckDate;
GO
```

### C. Use EXECUTE 'tsql_string' with a variable

The following example shows how `EXECUTE` handles dynamically built strings that contain variables. This example creates the `tables_cursor` cursor to hold a list of all user-defined tables in the [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database, and then uses that list to rebuild all indexes on the tables.

```sql
DECLARE tables_cursor CURSOR
    FOR SELECT s.name, t.name FROM sys.objects AS t
    INNER JOIN sys.schemas AS s ON s.schema_id = t.schema_id
    WHERE t.type = 'U';

OPEN tables_cursor;

DECLARE @schemaname AS sysname;
DECLARE @tablename AS sysname;

FETCH NEXT FROM tables_cursor INTO @schemaname, @tablename;

WHILE (@@FETCH_STATUS <> -1)
    BEGIN
        EXECUTE ('ALTER INDEX ALL ON ' +
            @schemaname + '.' +
            @tablename + ' REBUILD;');
        FETCH NEXT FROM tables_cursor INTO @schemaname, @tablename;
    END

PRINT 'The indexes on all tables have been rebuilt.';

CLOSE tables_cursor;

DEALLOCATE tables_cursor;
```

### D. Use EXECUTE with a remote stored procedure

The following example executes the `uspGetEmployeeManagers` stored procedure on the remote server `SQLSERVER1` and stores the return status that indicates success or failure in `@retstat`.

```sql
DECLARE @retstat AS INT;

EXECUTE
    @retstat = SQLSERVER1.AdventureWorks2022.dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers
    @BusinessEntityID = 6;
```

### E. Use EXECUTE with a stored procedure variable

The following example creates a variable that represents a stored procedure name.

```sql
DECLARE @proc_name AS VARCHAR (30);
SET @proc_name = 'sys.sp_who';

EXECUTE @proc_name;
```

### F. Use EXECUTE with DEFAULT

The following example creates a stored procedure with default values for the first and third parameters. When the procedure is run, these defaults are inserted for the first and third parameters when no value is passed in the call or when the default is specified. Note the various ways the `DEFAULT` keyword can be used.

```sql
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ProcTestDefaults', N'P') IS NOT NULL
    DROP PROCEDURE dbo.ProcTestDefaults;
GO

-- Create the stored procedure.
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ProcTestDefaults (
    @p1 SMALLINT = 42,
    @p2 CHAR (1),
    @p3 VARCHAR (8) = 'CAR'
)
AS
SET NOCOUNT ON;
SELECT @p1, @p2, @p3;
GO
```

The `Proc_Test_Defaults` stored procedure can be executed in many combinations.

```sql
-- Specifying a value only for one parameter (@p2).
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults @p2 = 'A';

-- Specifying a value for the first two parameters.
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults 68, 'B';

-- Specifying a value for all three parameters.
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults 68, 'C', 'House';

-- Using the DEFAULT keyword for the first parameter.
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults
    @p1 = DEFAULT,
    @p2 = 'D';

-- Specifying the parameters in an order different from the order defined in the procedure.
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults DEFAULT,
    @p3 = 'Local',
    @p2 = 'E';

-- Using the DEFAULT keyword for the first and third parameters.
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults DEFAULT, 'H', DEFAULT;
EXECUTE dbo.ProcTestDefaults DEFAULT, 'I', @p3 = DEFAULT;
```

### G. Use EXECUTE with AT *linked_server_name*

The following example passes a command string to a remote server. It creates a linked server `SeattleSales` that points to another instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and executes a DDL statement (`CREATE TABLE`) against that linked server.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_addlinkedserver 'SeattleSales', 'SQL Server';
GO

EXECUTE ('CREATE TABLE AdventureWorks2022.dbo.SalesTbl
(SalesID INT, SalesName VARCHAR(10)); ') AT SeattleSales;
GO
```

### H. Use EXECUTE WITH RECOMPILE

The following example executes the `Proc_Test_Defaults` stored procedure and forces a new query plan to be compiled, used, and discarded after the module is executed.

```sql
EXECUTE dbo.Proc_Test_Defaults @p2 = 'A' WITH RECOMPILE;
GO
```

### I. Use EXECUTE with a user-defined function

The following example executes the `ufnGetSalesOrderStatusText` scalar user-defined function in the [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database. It uses the variable `@returnstatus` to store the value returned by the function. The function expects one input parameter, `@Status`. This is defined as a **tinyint** data type.

```sql
DECLARE @returnstatus AS NVARCHAR (15);
SET @returnstatus = NULL;

EXECUTE
    @returnstatus = dbo.ufnGetSalesOrderStatusText
    @Status = 2;

PRINT @returnstatus;
GO
```

### J. Use EXECUTE to query an Oracle database on a linked server

The following example executes several `SELECT` statements at the remote Oracle server. The example begins by adding the Oracle server as a linked server and creating linked server login.

```sql
-- Setup the linked server.
EXECUTE sp_addlinkedserver
    @server = 'ORACLE',
    @srvproduct = 'Oracle',
    @provider = 'OraOLEDB.Oracle',
    @datasrc = 'ORACLE10';

EXECUTE sp_addlinkedsrvlogin
    @rmtsrvname = 'ORACLE',
    @useself = 'false',
    @locallogin = NULL,
    @rmtuser = 'scott',
    @rmtpassword = 'tiger';

EXECUTE sp_serveroption 'ORACLE', 'rpc out', true;
GO

-- Execute several statements on the linked Oracle server.
EXECUTE ('SELECT * FROM scott.emp') AT ORACLE;
GO

EXECUTE ('SELECT * FROM scott.emp WHERE MGR = ?', 7902) AT ORACLE;
GO

DECLARE @v AS INT;
SET @v = 7902;

EXECUTE ('SELECT * FROM scott.emp WHERE MGR = ?', @v) AT ORACLE;
GO
```

### K. Use EXECUTE AS USER to switch context to another user

The following example executes a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] string that creates a table and specifies the `AS USER` clause to switch the execution context of the statement from the caller to `User1`. The [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] checks the permissions of `User1` when the statement is run. `User1` must exist as a user in the database and must have permission to create tables in the `Sales` schema, or the statement fails.

```sql
EXECUTE ('CREATE TABLE Sales.SalesTable (SalesID INT, SalesName VARCHAR(10));')
AS USER = 'User1';
GO
```

### L. Use a parameter with EXECUTE and AT *linked_server_name*

The following example passes a command string to a remote server by using a question mark (`?`) placeholder for a parameter. The example creates a linked server `SeattleSales` that points to another instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and executes a `SELECT` statement against that linked server. The `SELECT` statement uses the question mark as a place holder for the `ProductID` parameter (`952`), which is provided after the statement.

```sql
-- Setup the linked server.
EXECUTE sp_addlinkedserver 'SeattleSales', 'SQL Server';
GO

-- Execute the SELECT statement.
EXECUTE ('SELECT ProductID, Name
    FROM AdventureWorks2022.Production.Product
    WHERE ProductID = ? ', 952) AT SeattleSales;
GO
```

### M. Use EXECUTE to redefine a single result set

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)].

Some of the previous examples executed `EXECUTE dbo.uspGetEmployeeManagers 6;` which returned seven columns. The following example demonstrates using the `WITH RESULT SET` syntax to change the names and data types of the returning result set.

```sql
EXECUTE uspGetEmployeeManagers 16 WITH RESULT SETS
((
    [Reporting Level] INT NOT NULL,
    [ID of Employee] INT NOT NULL,
    [Employee First Name] NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    [Employee Last Name] NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    [Employee ID of Manager] NVARCHAR (MAX) NOT NULL,
    [Manager First Name] NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    [Manager Last Name] NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
));
```

### N. Use EXECUTE to redefine a two result sets

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)].

When executing a statement that returns more than one result set, define each expected result set. The following example in [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] creates a procedure that returns two result sets. Then the procedure is executed using the `WITH RESULT SETS` clause, and specifying two result set definitions.

```sql
--Create the procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE Production.ProductList
@ProdName NVARCHAR (50)
AS
-- First result set
SELECT
    ProductID,
    Name,
    ListPrice
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Name LIKE @ProdName;
-- Second result set
SELECT Name,
    COUNT(S.ProductID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Production.Product AS P
    INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS S
        ON P.ProductID = S.ProductID
WHERE Name LIKE @ProdName
GROUP BY Name;
GO

-- Execute the procedure
EXECUTE Production.ProductList '%tire%' WITH RESULT SETS
(
    -- first result set definition starts here
    (ProductID INT,
    [Name] NAME,
    ListPrice MONEY)
    -- comma separates result set definitions
    ,
    -- second result set definition starts here
    ([Name] NAME,
    NumberOfOrders INT)
);
```

### O. Use EXECUTE with AT DATA_SOURCE *data_source_name* to query a remote SQL Server

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later versions.

The following example passes a command string to an external data source pointing to a SQL Server instance.

```sql
EXECUTE ( 'SELECT @@SERVERNAME' ) AT DATA_SOURCE my_sql_server;
GO
```

### P. Use EXECUTE with AT DATA_SOURCE *data_source_name* to query compute pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)].

The following example passes a command string to an external data source pointing to a compute pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster. The example creates a data source `SqlComputePool` against a compute pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster and executes a `SELECT` statement against the data source.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlComputePool
WITH (LOCATION = 'sqlcomputepool://controller-svc/default');

EXECUTE ('SELECT @@SERVERNAME') AT DATA_SOURCE SqlComputePool;
GO
```

### Q. Use EXECUTE with AT DATA_SOURCE *data_source_name* to query data pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)].

The following example passes a command string to an external data source pointing to compute pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster (BDC). The example creates a data source `SqlDataPool` against a data pool in BDC and executes a `SELECT` statement against the data source.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlDataPool
WITH (LOCATION = 'sqldatapool://controller-svc/default');

EXECUTE ('SELECT @@SERVERNAME') AT DATA_SOURCE SqlDataPool;
GO
```

### R. Use EXECUTE with AT DATA_SOURCE *data_source_name* to query storage pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)].

The following example passes a command string to an external data source pointing to compute pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster. The example creates a data source `SqlStoragePool` against a data pool in SQL Server Big Data Cluster and executes a `SELECT` statement against the data source.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlStoragePool
WITH (LOCATION = 'sqlhdfs://controller-svc/default');

EXECUTE ('SELECT @@SERVERNAME') AT DATA_SOURCE SqlStoragePool;
GO
```

## Examples: Azure Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE [article-uses-adventureworks](../../includes/article-uses-adventureworks.md)]

### A: Basic procedure execution

Execute a stored procedure:

```sql
EXECUTE proc1;
```

Call a stored procedure with name determined at runtime:

```sql
EXECUTE ('EXECUTE ' + @var);
```

Call a stored procedure from within a stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE sp_first AS EXECUTE sp_second; EXECUTE sp_third;
```

### B: Execute strings

Execute a SQL string:

```sql
EXECUTE ('SELECT * FROM sys.types');
```

Execute a nested string:

```sql
EXECUTE ('EXECUTE (''SELECT * FROM sys.types'')');
```

Execute a string variable:

```sql
DECLARE @stringVar AS NVARCHAR (100);
SET @stringVar = N'SELECT name FROM' + ' sys.sql_logins';

EXECUTE (@stringVar);
```

### C: Procedures with parameters

The following example creates a procedure with parameters and demonstrates three ways to execute the procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcWithParameters (
    @name NVARCHAR (50),
    @color NVARCHAR (15)
)
AS
SELECT ProductKey,
       EnglishProductName,
       Color
FROM [dbo].[DimProduct]
WHERE EnglishProductName LIKE @namef
      AND Color = @color;
GO
```

Execute using positional parameters:

```sql
EXECUTE ProcWithParameters N'%arm%', N'Black';
```

Execute using named parameters in order:

```sql
EXECUTE ProcWithParameters
    @name = N'%arm%',
    @color = N'Black';
```

Execute using named parameters out of order:

```sql
EXECUTE ProcWithParameters
    @color = N'Black',
    @name = N'%arm%';
GO
```
