### Table Designer

The Table Designer offers a new UI for creating and managing tables for your databases, with advanced capabilities to customize every aspect of the table's structure:

- **Columns**: Add new columns, set data types, define nullability, and specify default values. You can also designate a column as a primary key or identity column directly within the interface.

- **Primary Key**: Easily define one or more columns as the primary key for your table, ensuring each row is uniquely identifiable.

- **Indexes**: Create and manage indexes to improve query performance by adding additional columns as indexes for faster data retrieval.

- **Foreign Keys**: Define relationships between tables by adding foreign keys referencing primary keys in other tables, ensuring data integrity across tables.

- **Check Constraints**: Set up rules to enforce specific conditions on the data being entered, such as value ranges or patterns.

- **Advanced Options**: Configure more sophisticated properties and behaviors, such as system versioning and memory optimized tables.

Within the designer, the **Script As Create** panel provides an automatically generated T-SQL script that reflects your table design. You have the following options:

- **Publish**: Apply your changes directly to the database by selecting **Publish**. This action is powered by DacFX (Data-tier Application Framework), which ensures the smooth and reliable deployment of your schema updates.

- **Copy script**: You can copy the generated T-SQL script from the preview panel for manual execution or open it directly in the editor for further adjustments and modifications as needed.

### Query Results pane

The MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code provides an enhanced query results experience, helping you efficiently visualize and understand your data output. The query results display within the bottom panel of Visual Studio Code, which also hosts the integrated terminal, output, debug console, and other tools, creating a unified interface for easy access.

> [!TIP]  
> You can now open query results in a new tab for an expanded view, similar to the previous experience.

Key features of the Query Results pane include:

- **Grid View**: Displays query results in a familiar grid format, allowing for easy inspection of the data. You now have the option to display results in a New Tab for a clearer, more organized view

- **Copy Options**: Right-click within the results grid to access options like *Select All, Copy, Copy with Headers, and Copy Headers*, making it convenient to transfer data for other uses.

- **Save Query Results**: Includes the ability to save query results to multiple formats such as JSON, Excel, and CSV, allowing you to work with the data outside of Visual Studio Code.

- **Inline Sorting**: You can sort the data by clicking on the column headers directly in the query results view. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order to make it easier to analyze specific subsets of the data.

- **Estimated Plan**: The Estimated Plan button is located in the query toolbar, next to the Run Query button. It appears as a flowchart icon and allows you to generate an estimated execution plan without executing the query itself. This feature provides valuable insight into query performance, helping identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies before running the actual query.

- **Enable Actual Plan**: A new button labeled Enable Actual Plan, located right after Estimated Plan button in the upper right corner of the results pane, lets you view the actual query plan for executed queries. This addition provides deeper insight into query performance and helps identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

This updated query results experience is designed to offer flexibility and improved workflow integration, empowering developers to work more effectively with their data.

### Customization settings for the Query Results pane

You can customize your query results experience using specific settings. The table below explains these settings and the resulting behaviors:

| Setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Nothing set** | The default experience, referred to as the old user experience (UX). |
| `mssql.enableRichExperiences`: `true` | Activates the new user experience, which includes a refreshed query results pane. |
| `mssql.enableRichExperiences`: `true` and `mssql.openQueryResultsInTabByDefault`: `true` | Opens query results in a new tab by default, rather than displaying them in the bottom query pane. This can help declutter your workspace and provide a more organized view. |
| `mssql.enableRichExperiences`: `true` and `mssql.enableNewQueryResultsFeature`: `false` | Retains the new user experience but with the query results pane appearing in the old style. This setting is useful if you prefer the traditional look for the results pane while benefiting from other new user experience features. |

These settings give you flexibility in how you view and interact with query results, making it easier to adapt the experience to your workflow. To modify these settings, navigate to the settings in Visual Studio Code and update the configurations as needed.

### Query Plan Visualizer

The Query Plan Visualizer in the MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code allows developers to analyze SQL query performance by displaying detailed execution plans. This tool provides insights into how SQL queries are executed, helping developers identify bottlenecks and optimize their queries.

Key features and capabilities include:

- **Node Navigation**: Each step in the execution plan is represented as a node, allowing you to interact with the plan in various ways. You can select nodes to view tooltips or detailed information about specific operations. Additionally, you can collapse or expand node trees to simplify the view and focus on key areas of the query plan.
- **Zoom Controls**: The visualizer offers flexible zoom options to help you analyze the plan in detail. You can zoom in or out to adjust the level of detail, use the "zoom to fit" feature to resize the view and fit the entire plan on your screen, or set custom zoom levels to examine specific elements precisely.
- **Metrics and Highlighting**: The metrics toolbar allows you to analyze key performance indicators and highlight expensive operations. You can select metrics such as **Actual Elapsed Time**, **Cost**, **Subtree Cost**, or **Number of Rows Read** from the dropdown list to identify bottlenecks and use these metrics to search for specific nodes within the query plan for deeper analysis.

The right-hand sidebar provides quick access to additional actions:

- **Save Plan**: Save the current execution plan for future reference.
- **Open XML**: Open the XML representation of the query plan to inspect details at the code level.
- **Open Query**: View the query that generated the execution plan directly from the toolbar.
- **Toggle Tooltips**: Enable or disable tooltips for additional details on each node.
- **Properties**: View the properties of each node in the execution plan, with options to sort by importance or alphabetically.
