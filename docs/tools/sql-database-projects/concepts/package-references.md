# SQL projects package references overview

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Package references in SQL projects allow you to reference database objects from other projects or NuGet packages. The database objects added to a project through package references can be part of the same database, a different database on the same server, or a different database on a different server.

> [!NOTE]  
> Package references are the recommended method for referencing database objects in new development. Referencing NuGet packages is only supported in SDK-style SQL projects (preview).

## Database object package references

Package references are one of several methods for adding database objects to a SQL project as a [database reference](database-references.md). Package references can contain objects for the same database, a different database on the same server, or a different database on a different server. Package references can be used to break up a database into smaller, more manageable projects, which can help to reduce the time required to build a project during iterative local development.

### SQL project file sample and syntax

Package references are added to a SQL project through entries in the `.sqlproj` file, similar to C# projects. When a package reference is to a different database on the same server, a `<DatabaseSqlCmdVariable>` element is included in the package reference. When a package reference is to a different database on a different server, a `<ServerSqlCmdVariable>` element is also included in the package reference. Package references to the same database don't include `<ServerSqlCmdVariable>` or `<DatabaseSqlCmdVariable>` elements.

The following example includes a package reference to the `Contoso.AdventureWorks.SalesLT` package as a database reference for the same database where the objects in the package become part of the database model in the SQL project:

```xml
...
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.AdventureWorks.SalesLT" Version="1.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

### System databases

The SQL system databases (`master`, `msdb`) are published on NuGet.org as database reference packages. These packages contain the schema for the system databases and can be used as package references in SQL projects. The system database packages are versioned to align with the version of SQL Server they're associated with. For example, the `master` system database package for SQL Server 2022 is `Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.Master` version `160.2.1` and can be added to a SQL project as a package reference:

```xml
...
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.Master" Version="160.2.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Minor version changes reflect bug fixes and minor changes to the schema within a SQL Server version.

The available system database packages are:

- [SQL Server `master` system database](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.Master)
- [SQL Server `msdb` system database](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.Msdb)
- [Azure SQL Database `master` system database](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.Azure.Master)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics `master` system database](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.Synapse.Master)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics serverless pools `master` system database](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Dacpacs.SynapseServerless.Master)

### Package dacpac NuGet packages

A database reference package is a NuGet package that contains a `.dacpac` file. The NuGet package can be published to a NuGet feed, such as Azure Artifacts, for use in SQL projects. Creating this package follows the same process as creating a NuGet package for other types of projects. For more information, see [Creating a package with the dotnet CLI](/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-the-dotnet-cli).

To package a `.sqlproj` file as a NuGet package, use the `dotnet pack` command from the command line. By default, the `dotnet pack` command creates a NuGet package from the `.sqlproj` file in the `bin/Debug` folder.

Package metadata can be specified by properties inside the `<PropertyGroup>` element in the `.sqlproj` file. For example, the following properties specify the package ID, version, description, authors, and company:

```xml
<PackageId>Contoso.AdventureWorks.SalesLT</PackageId>
<Version>1.0.0</Version>
<Description>AdventureWorks database SalesLT objects</Description>
<Authors>DevTeam</Authors>
<Company>Contoso Outdoors</Company>
```

The `.nupkg` file created by the `dotnet pack` command can be published to a NuGet feed for use in SQL projects. This database objects can be viewed by anyone with access to the package, so consideration should be made for selecting a public or private feed location. For more information, see [Hosting with private package feeds](/nuget/hosting-packages/overview).
