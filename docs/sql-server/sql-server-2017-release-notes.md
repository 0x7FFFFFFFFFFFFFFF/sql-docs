## General availability release (October 2017)

### Database Engine

- **Issue and customer impact:** After upgrade, the existing FILESTREAM network share might be no longer available.

- **Workaround:** First, restart the computer and check if the FILESTREAM network share is available. If the share is still not available, complete the following steps:

  1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, right-click the SQL Server instance, and select **Properties**.
  1. In the **FILESTREAM** tab clear **Enable FILESTREAM for file I/O streaming access**, then select **Apply**.
  1. Check **Enable FILESTREAM for file I/O streaming access** again with the original share name and select **Apply**.

### Master Data Services (MDS)

- **Issue and customer impact:**

  On the user permissions page, when granting permission to the root level in the entity tree view, you see the following error:
`"The model permission can't be saved. The object guid isn't valid"`

- **Workaround:**

  - Grant permission on the sub nodes in the tree view instead of the root level.

### Analysis Services

- **Issue and customer impact:** Data connectors for the following sources aren't yet available for tabular models at the 1400 compatibility level.

  - Amazon Redshift
  - IBM Netezza
  - Impala

- **Workaround:** None.

- **Issue and customer impact:** Direct Query models at the 1400 compatibility level with perspectives can fail on querying or discovering metadata.

- **Workaround:** Remove perspectives and redeploy.

### Tools

- **Issue and customer impact:** Running *DReplay* fails with the following message:

  ```output
  Error DReplay Unexpected error occurred!
  ```

- **Workaround:** None.
