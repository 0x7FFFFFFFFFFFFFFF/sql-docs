# Upgrade SQL Server

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server -Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

You can upgrade instances of [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ss2016](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [sssql17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE [sssql19](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] directly to [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. For [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)], you need to either do a side-by-side upgrade, or a migration, to move to [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] as there's no common overlap between a supported mainstream operating system. Before running setup to upgrade, review the following articles about the upgrade process and the release notes.

Check out what's new in each version of the product:

- [SQL Server 2022 release notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-2022-release-notes.md)
- [SQL Server 2019 release notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-2019-release-notes.md)
- [SQL Server 2017 release notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-2017-release-notes.md)
- [SQL Server 2016 release notes](../../sql-server/sql-server-2016-release-notes.md)

Support for [!INCLUDE [sssql14-md](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] ended on July 9, 2024. For new end of support options, see [End of Support for Windows Server and SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/end-of-support).

If you're upgrading from an end-of-support version of SQL Server, see the [end of support options](../../sql-server/end-of-support/sql-server-end-of-support-overview.md).
