# Hide an item (Report Builder)

In this article, learn how to set the visibility of a report item based on a report parameter or another expression in Report Builder. You can conditionally hide an item to improve the user experience. You can also design a report to allow the user to toggle report item visibility by selecting text boxes in the report. For more information, see [Add an expand or collapse action to a Report Builder paginated report](../../reporting-services/report-design/add-an-expand-or-collapse-action-to-an-item-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).

The following sections describe how to show or hide a report item in a rendered report based on a constant or an expression.

        > When you specify an expression for visibility, you set the Hidden property of the report item, as shown in the following image. The evaluated expression shows the report item when the value is **False** and hides the report item when the value is **True**.
