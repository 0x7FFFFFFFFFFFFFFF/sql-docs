Learn how to start Microsoft Report Builder from the Reporting Services web portal. Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] is a stand-alone report authoring environment. With it, you can create paginated reports and publish them to a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server.

The first time you start [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] from the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] web portal, you can [download Report Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53613) from the Microsoft Download Center by selecting **Get Report Builder**.

You or an administrator can install Report Builder on your computer from the Microsoft Download Center. For more information, see [Install Report Builder](../../reporting-services/install-windows/install-report-builder.md).

When you start [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] from the web portal or SharePoint site, if an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] opens, contact your administrator. The administrator can update the version on the web portal or SharePoint site.

## Prerequisites

- SQL Server 2016 (13.x) or later.
- Connection to a report server database.
- Access to the Reporting Services web portal. 

## Start Report Builder from the Reporting Services web portal

1. In your web browser, go to the URL for your report server. By default, the URL is `https://<servername>/reports`.

1. In the web portal's menu bar, select **New** and choose **Paginated Report**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/start-report-builder/web-portal-new-paginated-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New Paginated Report menu.":::

     The first time you start Report Builder with the **Paginated Report** option, you receive the prompt to [install Report Builder](../../reporting-services/install-windows/install-report-builder.md).

     After the first time, [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] opens, and you can create a paginated report or open a report from the report server.

## Start Report Builder in SharePoint integrated mode

1. Navigate to the SharePoint site that contains the library you want.

1. Open the library.

1. Select **Documents**.

1. On the **New Document** menu, select **Report Builder Report**.

     The first time, this action launches the SQL Server [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] Wizard. For more information, see [Install Report Builder](../../reporting-services/install-windows/install-report-builder.md).

     [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] opens, and you can create a paginated report or open a report on the report server.

     > [!NOTE]  
     > If the **New Document** menu doesn't list **Report Builder Report**, **Report Builder Model**, or **Report Data Source**, their content types need to be added to the SharePoint library. For more information, see [Add Reporting Services content types to a SharePoint library](../../reporting-services/report-server-sharepoint/add-reporting-services-content-types-to-a-sharepoint-library.md).
