## Tools for report content management

Graphical and scripting tools are available for managing content in [!INCLUDE[SSRS](../../includes/ssrs.md)]. The tools that you use depend on the deployment mode of your report server.

### Report server web service URL

The report server web service acts as a communications interface between client programs and the report server. The URL of this service provides access to the full functionality of the report server. You can use this tool to browse content in the report catalog in a generic item navigation page.

For more information, see [Report Server web service](../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/report-server-web-service.md).

#### Web service URL access

You use a browser to access the web service URL.

### Web portal

You can use the web portal to administer a single report server instance from a remote location over an HTTP connection. The web portal is only available for native mode report servers.

You can use this tool for the following tasks:

- Viewing, searching, printing, and subscribing to reports
- Organizing, creating, securing, and maintaining the folder hierarchy
- Configuring role-based security that determines access to items and operations
- Configuring report execution properties, report history, and report parameters
- Creating report models that connect to and retrieve data from a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services data source or from a SQL Server relational data source
- Setting model item security to allow access to specific entities in the model, or mapping entities to predefined click-through reports that you create in advance
- Creating shared schedules and shared data sources
- Making schedules and data source connections more manageable
- Creating data-driven subscriptions that roll out reports to a large recipient list
- Creating linked reports to reuse and repurpose an existing report in different ways
- Opening Report Builder to create reports that you can save and run on the report server

For more information, see [What is the report server web portal (native mode)?](../../reporting-services/web-portal-ssrs-native-mode.md).
