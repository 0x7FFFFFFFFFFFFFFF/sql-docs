Report Builder lets you create pie charts and other visualizations to represent your data in a report. Within these charts, you can further customize how they look and behave to make them more useful for your report, including how percentages and legends display on your charts. By default the legend for pie charts shows categories. You might also want percentages in the legend or the pie slices themselves.

The [Tutorial: Add a pie chart to your report (Report Builder)](../tutorial-add-a-pie-chart-to-your-report-report-builder.md) walks you through adding percentages to pie slices, if you'd like to practice with sample data.

## Display percentage values as labels on a pie chart

1. From the **Insert** on the Report Builder menu, select **Chart** and then either **Chart Wizard...** or **Insert Chart**. For more information, see [Add a chart to a paginated report (Report Builder)](../../reporting-services/report-design/add-a-chart-to-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).

1. On the **Select Chart Type** dialog box, select one of the pie chart options under **Shape** in the **Column** tab. Or select **Pie** in the **Chart Wizard** on the **Choose a chart type** page.

1. On the **Design** surface, right-click on the pie chart and select **Show Data Labels**. The data labels appear within each slice on the pie chart.

1. On the design surface, right-click on the labels and select **Series Label Properties**. The **Series Label Properties** dialog box appears.

1. Enter `#PERCENT` for the **Label data** field.

1. (Optional) To specify how many decimal places the label shows, enter `#PERCENT{P*n*}` where `*n*` is the number of decimal places to display. For example, to display no decimal places, enter `#PERCENT{P0}`.

1. Select **OK**.

## Display percentage values in the legend of a pie chart

1. On the design surface, right-click on the pie chart and select **Series Properties**. The **Series Properties** dialog box displays.
