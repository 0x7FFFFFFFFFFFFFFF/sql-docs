# Change row height or column width in a Report Builder paginated report

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

When you set a row height, you're specifying the maximum height for the row in the rendered paginated report. However, by default text boxes in the row are set to grow vertically to accommodate their data at run-time. This setting can cause a row to expand beyond the height that you specify. To set a fixed row height, you must change the text box properties so they don't automatically expand.  
  
When you set a column width, you specify the maximum width for the column in the rendered report. Columns don't automatically adjust horizontally to accommodate text.  
  
If a cell in a row or column contains a rectangle or data region, the height and width of the contained item determines the minimum height and width of the cell. For more information, see [Rendering behaviors in a paginated report (Report Builder)](../../reporting-services/report-design/rendering-behaviors-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).
