Your password should follow the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] default [password policy](../../relational-databases/security/password-policy.md). By default, the password must be at least eight characters long and contain characters from three of the following four sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, base-10 digits, and symbols. Passwords can be up to 128 characters long. Use passwords that are as long and complex as possible.
