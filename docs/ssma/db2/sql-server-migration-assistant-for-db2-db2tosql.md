# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Db2 (Db2ToSQL)

SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2 is a tool for migrating Db2 databases to [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Windows and Linux, or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. SSMA for Db2 converts Db2 database objects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL objects, loads those objects into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from Db2 to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.

This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Db2 and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating Db2 databases to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The following table shows articles to help you learn more:
