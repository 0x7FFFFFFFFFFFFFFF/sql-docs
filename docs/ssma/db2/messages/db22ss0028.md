# DB22SS0028: ROWID column generated (Info)

This article describes the reason why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2 adds `ROWID` column to the table, if there are triggers.

## Background

In Db2 you can create a trigger that runs `FOR EACH ROW`, rather than for the entire set of rows that is changing. In SQL Server, triggers always execute for the entire set of modified rows. If row-level Db2 trigger accesses both `OLD` and `NEW` correlation names, then SSMA needs a way to match rows from both row sets, to identify what the value was for a given row before and after the update. To emulate such per-row functionality, SSMA adds special `ROWID` column to uniquely identify each modified row and uses it to establish a relationship between `inserted` and `deleted` row sets.

## Examples

Consider the following Db2 trigger, which executes for each row updated in `TRIG_TEST` table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TSCHM.TRIG_TEST_AU
AFTER UPDATE OF DATA ON TSCHM.TRIG_TEST
REFERENCING OLD AS O NEW AS N
FOR EACH ROW
MODE DB2SQL
BEGIN ATOMIC
    IF (N.DATA = 'ABC') THEN
        INSERT INTO TSCHM.TRIG_TEST(DATA) VALUES ('-' || O.DATA);
    END IF;
END
```

When you try to convert this trigger in SSMA, the following T-SQL is produced within the SQL Server trigger:

1. Run a cursor over `inserted` row set, selecting `ROWID` and `DATA` columns into `@new$0` and `@new$DATA` variables:

   ```sql
   DECLARE
       ForEachInsertedRowTriggerCursor CURSOR LOCAL FORWARD_ONLY READ_ONLY FOR
       SELECT ROWID, DATA
       FROM inserted

   OPEN ForEachInsertedRowTriggerCursor

   FETCH ForEachInsertedRowTriggerCursor
       INTO @new$0, @new$DATA
   ```

1. Select matching row from `deleted` row set into `@old$0` and `@old$DATA` variables, based on the inserted `ROWID` (stored in `@new$0` variable):

   ```sql
   SELECT @old$0 = ROWID, @old$DATA = DATA
   FROM deleted
   WHERE ROWID = @new$0
   ```

1. Perform trigger actions using `@old$DATA`/`@new$DATA` variables:

   ```sql
   IF (@new$DATA = 'ABC')
       INSERT SSMAADMIN.TRIG_TEST(DATA)
       VALUES (('-' + ISNULL(@old$DATA, '')))
   ```

## Remarks

This behavior is controlled by the **Generate ROWID column** project setting, which can be found under **Tools** > **Project Settings** > **General** > **Conversion** > **ROWID generation**. If the setting is **No**, but during trigger conversion SSMA identifies that it requires a `ROWID` column, then [DB22SS0239: ROWID column not accessible (Error)](db22ss0239.md) conversion error is generated.
