# DB22SS0239: ROWID column not accessible (Error)

This article describes the reason why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2 requires a `ROWID` column to be defined for the table with triggers.

## Background

In Db2 you can create a trigger that runs `FOR EACH ROW`, rather than for the entire set of rows that is changing. In SQL Server, triggers always execute for the entire set of modified rows. If row-level Db2 trigger accesses both - `OLD` and `NEW` correlation names, then SSMA needs a way to match rows from both row sets in order to identify what the value was for a given row before and after the update. To emulate such "for each row" functionality, SSMA adds special `ROWID` column to uniquely identify each modified row and uses it to establish a relationship between `inserted` and `deleted` row sets.

This behavior is controlled by the **Generate ROWID column** project setting, which can be found under **Tools** > **Project Settings** > **General** > **Conversion** > **ROWID generation**. If the setting is set to **No**, then the `ROWID` column isn't added to the table, and SSMA can't convert such triggers.

## Examples

Consider the following Db2 trigger, which executes for each row updated in `TRIG_TEST` table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TSCHM.TRIG_TEST_AU
AFTER UPDATE OF DATA ON TSCHM.TRIG_TEST
REFERENCING OLD AS O NEW AS N
FOR EACH ROW
MODE DB2SQL
BEGIN ATOMIC
    IF (N.DATA = 'ABC') THEN
        INSERT INTO TSCHM.TRIG_TEST(DATA) VALUES ('-' || O.DATA);
    END IF;
END
```

When you try to convert this trigger in SSMA, if the **Generate ROWID column** project setting is set to **No**, then SSMA generates the following error message:

> DB22SS0239: ROWID column not accessible

## Possible remedies

Change the **Generate ROWID column** project setting to **Add ROWID column for tables with triggers**, which allows SSMA to produce the following T-SQL within the SQL Server trigger when converting the previous example:

1) Run a cursor over `inserted` row set, selecting `ROWID` and `DATA` columns into `@new$0` and `@new$DATA` variables:

    ```sql
    DECLARE
        ForEachInsertedRowTriggerCursor CURSOR LOCAL FORWARD_ONLY READ_ONLY FOR
        SELECT ROWID, DATA
        FROM inserted

    OPEN ForEachInsertedRowTriggerCursor

    FETCH ForEachInsertedRowTriggerCursor
        INTO @new$0, @new$DATA
    ```

2) Select matching row from `deleted` row set into `@old$0` and `@old$DATA` variables, based on the inserted `ROWID` (stored in `@new$0` variable):

    ```sql
    SELECT @old$0 = ROWID, @old$DATA = DATA
    FROM deleted
    WHERE ROWID = @new$0
    ```

3) Perform trigger actions using `@old$DATA`/`@new$DATA` variables:

    ```sql
    IF (@new$DATA = 'ABC')
        INSERT SSMAADMIN.TRIG_TEST(DATA)
        VALUES (('-' + ISNULL(@old$DATA, '')))
    ```
