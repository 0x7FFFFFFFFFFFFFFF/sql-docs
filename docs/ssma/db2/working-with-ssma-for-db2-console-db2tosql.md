# Work with SSMA for Db2 console (Db2ToSQL)

The SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) release for Db2 is accessible through a console application at the command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.

This section explains the procedure to migrate the Db2 database using the SSMA console application.
