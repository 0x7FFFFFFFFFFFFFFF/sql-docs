# Build database objects with common language runtime (CLR) integration

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can build database objects using the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] integration with the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR). Managed code that runs inside of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is called a *CLR routine*. These routines include:

- Scalar-valued user-defined functions (scalar UDFs)
- Table-valued user-defined functions (TVFs)
- User-defined procedures (UDPs)
- User-defined triggers

CLR routines have the same structure in managed code. They're mapped to public, static (shared in Visual Basic .NET) methods of a class. In addition to routines, user-defined types (UDTs) and user-defined aggregate functions can also be defined using the .NET Framework. UDTs and user-defined aggregates are mapped to entire .NET Framework classes.

Each type of .NET Framework routine has a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] declaration and can be used anywhere in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that the [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] equivalent can be used. For instance, scalar UDFs can be used in any scalar expression. A TVF can be used in any `FROM` clause. A procedure can be invoked in an `EXEC` statement or invoked from a client application.

Execution of a CLR object (user-defined function, user-defined type, or trigger) on the common language runtime can take place on multiple threads (parallel plan), if the query optimizer decides it's beneficial. However, if a user-defined function accesses data, execution is on a serial plan.
