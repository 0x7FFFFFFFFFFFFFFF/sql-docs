# Get started with CLR integration

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article provides an overview of the namespaces and libraries required to compile database objects using the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] integration with the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR). The article also shows you how to write, compile, and run a small CLR stored procedure written in [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET.

## Required namespaces

The components required to develop basic CLR database objects are installed with [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. CLR integration functionality is exposed in an assembly called `System.Data.dll`, which is part of the .NET Framework. This assembly can be found in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and in the .NET Framework directory. Typically, a reference to this assembly is automatically added by both command line tools and Visual Studio, so there's no need to add it manually.

The `System.Data.dll` assembly contains the following namespaces, which are required for compiling CLR database objects:

- `System.Data`
- `System.Data.Sql`
- `Microsoft.SqlServer.Server`
- `System.Data.SqlTypes`

> [!TIP]  
> Loading CLR database objects on Linux is supported, but they must be built with the .NET Framework (SQL Server CLR integration doesn't support .NET Core, or .NET 5 and later versions). Also, CLR assemblies with the `EXTERNAL_ACCESS` or `UNSAFE` permission set aren't supported on Linux.

## Write a "Hello World" stored procedure

Copy and paste the following [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET code into a text editor, and save it in a file named `helloworld.cs` or `helloworld.vb`.

### [C#](#tab/cs)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using Microsoft.SqlServer.Server;
using System.Data.SqlTypes;

public class HelloWorldProc
{
    [Microsoft.SqlServer.Server.SqlProcedure]
    public static void HelloWorld(out string text)
    {
        SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Hello world!" + Environment.NewLine);
        text = "Hello world!";
    }
}
```

### [Visual Basic .NET](#tab/vb)

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Data
Imports Microsoft.SqlServer.Server
Imports System.Data.SqlTypes
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices

Public Class HelloWorldProc
    <Microsoft.SqlServer.Server.SqlProcedure> _
    Public Shared  Sub HelloWorld(\<Out()> ByRef text as String)
        SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Hello world!" & Environment.NewLine)
        text = "Hello world!"
    End Sub
End Class
```

This program contains a single static method on a public class. This method uses two new classes, [SqlContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.sqlserver.server.sqlcontext) and [SqlPipe](/dotnet/api/microsoft.sqlserver.server.sqlpipe), for creating managed database objects to output a short text message. The method also assigns the string "Hello world!" as the value of an `out` parameter. This method can be declared as a stored procedure in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then run in the same manner as a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] stored procedure.

Compile this program as a library, load it into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and run it as a stored procedure.

## Compile the "Hello World" stored procedure

[!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installs the .NET Framework redistribution files by default. These files include `csc.exe` and `vbc.exe`, the command-line compilers for [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET programs. In order to compile our sample, you must modify your path variable to point to the directory containing `csc.exe` or `vbc.exe`. The following path is the default installation path of the .NET Framework.

`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\(version)`

Version contains the version number of the installed .NET Framework. For example:

`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.8.0`

Once you add the .NET Framework directory to your path, you can compile the sample stored procedure into an assembly with the following command. The `/target` option allows you to compile it into an assembly.

For [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] source files:

`csc /target:library helloworld.cs`

For [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET source files:

`vbc /target:library helloworld.vb`

These commands launch the [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET compiler using the `/target` option to specify building a library DLL.

## Load and run the "Hello World" stored procedure in SQL Server

Once the sample procedure compiles successfully, you can test it in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. To do this, open [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and create a new query, connecting to a suitable test database (for example, the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database).

The ability to execute common language runtime (CLR) code is set to `OFF` by default in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The CLR code can be enabled by using the `sp_configure` system stored procedure. For more information, see [Enable CLR integration](../clr-integration-enabling.md).

We need to create the assembly so we can access the stored procedure. For this example, we assume that you created the `helloworld.dll` assembly in the `C:\` directory. Add the following [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement to your query.

`CREATE ASSEMBLY helloworld from 'C:\helloworld.dll' WITH PERMISSION_SET = SAFE`

Once the assembly is created, we can now access our HelloWorld method by using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. We call our stored procedure `hello`:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE hello
(@i NCHAR (25) OUTPUT)
AS EXTERNAL NAME helloworld.HelloWorldProc.HelloWorld;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> In the previous example, if the `HelloWorldProc` class is inside a namespace (called `MyNS`), the last line in the create procedure statement would be `EXTERNAL NAME helloworld.[MyNS.HelloWorldProc].HelloWorld;`.

Once the procedure is created, it can be run just like a normal stored procedure written in [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. Execute the following command:

```sql
DECLARE @J AS NCHAR (25);
EXECUTE hello @J OUTPUT;
PRINT @J;
```

Here's the expected output.

```output
Hello world!
Hello world!
```

## Remove the "Hello World" stored procedure sample

When you're finished running the sample stored procedure, you can remove the procedure and the assembly from your test database.

First, remove the procedure using the drop procedure command.

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT name
           FROM sysobjects
           WHERE name = 'hello')
    DROP PROCEDURE hello;
```

Once the procedure is dropped, you can remove the assembly containing your sample code.

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT name
           FROM sys.assemblies
           WHERE name = 'helloworld')
    DROP ASSEMBLY helloworld;
```
