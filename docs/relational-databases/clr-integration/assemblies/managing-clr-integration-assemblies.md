# Manage CLR integration assemblies

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Managed code is compiled and then deployed in units called a common language runtime (CLR) assembly. An assembly is packaged as a DLL or executable (`.exe`) file. While an executable file can run on its own, a DLL must be hosted in an existing application. Managed DLL assemblies can be loaded into and hosted by [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires you to register the assembly in a database using the `CREATE ASSEMBLY` statement, before it can be loaded in the process and used. Assemblies can also be updated from a more recent version using the `ALTER ASSEMBLY` statement, or removed from [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the `DROP ASSEMBLY` statement.

Assembly information is stored in the `sys.assembly_files` table in the database where the assembly is installed. The `sys.assembly_files` table contains the following columns.

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `assembly_id` | The identifier defined for the assembly. This number is assigned to all objects relating to the same assembly. |
| `name` | The name of the object. |
| `file_id` | A number identifying each object, with the first object associated with a given `assembly_id` being given the value of 1. If multiple objects are associated with the same `assembly_id`, then each subsequent `file_id` value is incremented by 1. |
| `content` | The hexadecimal representation of the assembly or file. |
