# Data access from CLR database objects

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

A common language runtime (CLR) routine might easily access data stored in the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in which it runs, and data stored in remote instances. The user context in which the code runs, determines the particular data the routine can access. Access data from within a CLR database object by using the .NET Framework Data Provider for [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], also referred to as `SqlClient`. This is the same provider used by developers accessing [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data from managed client and middle-tier applications. Because of this, you can use your knowledge of ADO.NET and `SqlClient` in client and middle-tier applications.

User-defined type methods and user-defined functions aren't allowed to perform data access by default. You must set the `DataAccess` property of `SqlMethodAttribute` or `SqlFunctionAttribute` to `DataAccessKind.Read` to enable read-only data access from user-defined type (UDT) methods or user-defined functions. Data modification operations aren't allowed from UDTs or user-defined functions, and throw exceptions at execution time if attempted.

This section discusses only the specific functional and behavioral differences when accessing data from within a CLR database object. For more information about the features and functionality of ADO.NET, see the ADO.NET documentation included in the .NET Framework SDK.
