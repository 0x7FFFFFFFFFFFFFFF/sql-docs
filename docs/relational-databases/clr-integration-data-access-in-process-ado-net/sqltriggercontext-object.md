# SqlTriggerContext object

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR) `SqlTriggerContext` class provides context information about the trigger. This contextual information includes the type of action that caused the trigger to fire, which columns were modified in an `UPDATE` operation, and, with a data definition language (DDL) trigger, an XML `EventData` structure that describes the triggering operation.

For more information and examples of how to use the `SqlTriggerContext` class, see [CLR triggers](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/clr-triggers) and [Microsoft.SqlServer.Server.SqlTriggerContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.sqlserver.server.sqltriggercontext).
