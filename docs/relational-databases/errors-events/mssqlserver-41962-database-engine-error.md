|Message Text|Operation was aborted as replication to Azure SQL Managed Instance did not start within %u minutes since it was initiated. Please verify the network connectivity and firewall rules are configured according to the guidelines described at https://aka.ms/mi-link-troubleshooting, and retry the operation.|  
  
## Explanation  

The operation to create the link was aborted because replication between your SQL Server instance and Azure SQL Managed Instance didn't start within 5 minutes of the operation being initiated. This could be due to network connectivity issues or incorrectly configured firewall rules.
  
## User action  

Verify that network connectivity was successfully established between SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, and that firewall rules are correctly configured, as described in [Configure network connectivity](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/managed-instance-link-preparation#configure-network-connectivity). Retry the operation after connection has been verified successfully.
