# Create CLR functions

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

You can create a database object inside an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is programmed in an assembly created in the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR). Database objects that can use the rich programming model provided by the common language runtime include aggregate functions, functions, stored procedures, triggers, and types.

Creating a CLR function in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] involves the following steps:

- Define the function as a static method of a class in a language supported by the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. For more information about how to program functions in the common language runtime, see [CLR user-defined functions](../clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-functions/clr-user-defined-functions.md). Then, compile the class to build an assembly in the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] by using the appropriate language compiler.

- Register the assembly in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using the `CREATE ASSEMBLY` statement. For more information about assemblies in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Assemblies (Database Engine)](../clr-integration/assemblies-database-engine.md).

- Create the function that references the registered assembly by using the [CREATE FUNCTION](../../t-sql/statements/create-function-transact-sql.md) statement.

Executing CLR code is off by default in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can create, alter, and drop database objects that reference managed code modules, but these references don't execute in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], unless the [clr enabled](../../database-engine/configure-windows/clr-enabled-server-configuration-option.md) server configuration option is enabled by using [sp_configure](../system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md).

Deploying a SQL Server Project in [!INCLUDE [vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] registers an assembly in the database that was specified for the project. Deploying the project also creates CLR functions in the database for all methods annotated with the `SqlFunction` attribute. For more information, see [Deploy CLR database objects](../clr-integration/deploying-clr-database-objects.md).

## Access external resources

You can use CLR functions to access external resources such as files, network resources, web services, and other databases (including remote instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]). CLR functions can use various classes in [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], such as `System.IO`, `System.WebServices`, `System.Sql`, and so on. The assembly that contains such functions should at least be configured with the `EXTERNAL_ACCESS` permission set for this purpose. For more information, see [CREATE ASSEMBLY](../../t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql.md).

The SQL Client Managed Provider can be used to access remote instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. However, loopback connections to the originating server aren't supported in CLR functions.

### Create, modify, or drop assemblies in SQL Server

- [CREATE ASSEMBLY (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql.md)
- [ALTER ASSEMBLY (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-assembly-transact-sql.md)
- [DROP ASSEMBLY (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/drop-assembly-transact-sql.md)

### Create a CLR function

- [CREATE FUNCTION (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/create-function-transact-sql.md)

## Access native code

CLR functions can access native (unmanaged) code, such as code written in C or C++, via the use of `PInvoke` from managed code (see [Calling Native Functions from Managed Code](/cpp/dotnet/calling-native-functions-from-managed-code) for details). You can reuse legacy code as CLR UDFs, or write performance-critical UDFs in native code, and requires using an `UNSAFE` assembly. See [CLR integration Code Access Security](../clr-integration/security/clr-integration-code-access-security.md) for cautions about use of `UNSAFE` assemblies.
