# Disable resource governor

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

You can disable resource governor using either [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

Disabling resource governor has the following immediate effects:

- The classifier function isn't executed when a new connection is opened.
- New connections are automatically classified into the `default` workload group.
- All existing workload group and resource pool settings are reset to their default values.
- No events are fired when limits are reached.
- Resource governor configuration changes can be made, but the changes don't take effect until resource governor is enabled.
