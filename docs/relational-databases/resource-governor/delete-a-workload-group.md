# Delete a workload group

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

You can delete a workload group or resource pool using either [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

### Limitations

You can't delete a workload group if it contains active sessions.

If a workload group contains active sessions, deleting the workload group fails when the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement is executed to apply the change. To avoid this problem, you can take one of the following actions:

- Wait until all sessions in the affected group disconnect, and then execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement.
- Explicitly stop sessions in the affected group by using the [KILL](../../t-sql/language-elements/kill-transact-sql.md) command, and then execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement. If you decide that you don't want to explicitly stop sessions, re-create the group by using the original name and settings.
- Restart the server. When the server restarts, the deleted group is deleted permanently.

## Delete a workload group using Object Explorer in SQL Server Management Studio

To delete a workload group using [[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md):

1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], open Object Explorer and expand the **Management** node down to and including **Resource Pools**.
1. Expand **Resource Pools** down to and including the **Workload Groups** node in the resource pool that contains the workload group to be deleted.
1. Open the context menu for the workload group and select **Delete**.
1. In the **Delete Object** window, the workload group is listed in the **Object to be deleted** list. To delete the workload group, select **OK**.

## Delete a workload group using resource governor properties

To delete a workload group by using the resource governor properties page:

1. In Object Explorer, expand the **Management** node down to and including **Resource Pools**.
1. Open the context menu for the resource pool that contains the workload group to be deleted and select **Properties**. This opens the **Resource Governor Properties** page.
1. In the **Workload groups for resource pool** window, select the row for the workload group to be deleted. Open the context menu and select **Delete**.
1. To delete the workload group, select **OK**.

## Delete a workload group using Transact-SQL

To delete a workload group using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]:

1. Execute the [DROP WORKLOAD GROUP](../../t-sql/statements/drop-workload-group-transact-sql.md) statement specifying the name of the workload group to delete.
1. Before you execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement, verify that there are no active requests in the workload group being deleted. If there are active requests, `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR` fails. For more information and for solutions, see [Limitations and restrictions](#LimitationsRestrictions).
1. Execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement.

### Example

The following example deletes a workload group named `groupAdhoc` and makes the new configuration effective.

```sql
DROP WORKLOAD GROUP groupAdhoc;

ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
```
