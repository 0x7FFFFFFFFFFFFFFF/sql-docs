## Limitations

- You can't delete the built-in `default` or `internal` resource pools.
- You can't delete a resource pool if it contains workload groups. For more information, see [Delete a workload group](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/delete-a-workload-group.md).

## Delete a resource pool using Object Explorer

To delete a resource pool using [[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md):

1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], open Object Explorer and expand the **Management** node down to and including **Resource Governor**.
1. Open the context menu of the resource pool to be deleted and select **Delete**.
1. In the **Delete Object** window, the resource pool is listed in the **Object to be deleted** list. To delete the resource pool, select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the resource pool that you are trying to delete contains a workload group, this action fails.

## Delete a resource pool using Transact-SQL

To delete a resource pool using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]:

1. Execute the [DROP RESOURCE POOL](../../t-sql/statements/drop-resource-pool-transact-sql.md) or [DROP EXTERNAL RESOURCE POOL](../../t-sql/statements/drop-external-resource-pool-transact-sql.md) statement specifying the name of the resource pool to delete.
1. Execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement for the changes to take effect.

### Example

The following example deletes a resource pool named `poolAdhoc` and makes the new configuration effective.

```sql
DROP RESOURCE POOL poolAdhoc;

ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
```
