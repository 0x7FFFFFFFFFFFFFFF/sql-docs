# Create CLR triggers

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can create a database object inside [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is programmed in an assembly created in the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR). Database objects that can use the rich programming model provided by the CLR include DML triggers, DDL triggers, stored procedures, functions, aggregate functions, and types.

Creating a CLR trigger (DML or DDL) in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] involves the following steps:

- Define the trigger as a class in a .NET Framework-supported language. For more information about how to program triggers in the CLR, see [CLR Triggers](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/clr-triggers). Then, compile the class to build an assembly in the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] using the appropriate language compiler.

- Register the assembly in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the `CREATE ASSEMBLY` statement. For more information about assemblies in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Assemblies (Database Engine)](../clr-integration/assemblies-database-engine.md).

- Create the trigger that references the registered assembly.

> [!NOTE]  
> Deploying a SQL Server Project in [!INCLUDE [vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] registers an assembly in the database that was specified for the project. Deploying the project also creates CLR triggers in the database for all methods annotated with the `SqlTrigger` attribute. For more information, see [Deploy CLR database objects](../clr-integration/deploying-clr-database-objects.md).

Executing CLR code is off by default in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can create, alter, and drop database objects that reference managed code modules, but these references don't execute in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], unless the [clr enabled](../../database-engine/configure-windows/clr-enabled-server-configuration-option.md) server configuration option is enabled by using [sp_configure](../system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md).

## Create, modify, or drop an assembly

- [CREATE ASSEMBLY](../../t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql.md)
- [ALTER ASSEMBLY](../../t-sql/statements/alter-assembly-transact-sql.md)
- [DROP ASSEMBLY](../../t-sql/statements/drop-assembly-transact-sql.md)

## Create a CLR trigger
