# sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools_history_ex

[!INCLUDE [asdb-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Each row represents a periodic snapshot of resource pool statistics in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssazuremi-md](../../includes/ssazuremi-md.md)]. A snapshot is taken when the database engine starts, and every few seconds thereafter. The interval between the current and the previous snapshot can vary, and is provided in the `duration_ms` column. The latest available snapshots are returned, up to 128 snapshots for each resource pool.

## Permissions

Requires the `VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE` permission.

## Remarks

Users can access this dynamic management view to monitor near real time resource consumption for the user workload pool and the system internal pools in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssazuremi-md](../../includes/ssazuremi-md.md)].

When connected to a database in an elastic pool, a resource pool represents the resources available to the entire elastic pool. When connected to a single database, a resource pool represents the resources available to the database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most of the data in this DMV is intended for internal consumption and is subject to change.

## Examples

The following example returns maximum log rate data and consumption at each snapshot by user pool:

```sql
SELECT snapshot_time,
       name,
       max_log_rate_kb,
       delta_log_bytes_used
FROM sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools_history_ex
WHERE name LIKE 'SloSharedPool1'
ORDER BY snapshot_time DESC;
```
