# sys.dm_os_memory_health_history

[!INCLUDE [Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb-asdbmi.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The `sys.dm_os_memory_health_history` dynamic management view is in preview. Schema and provided data are subject to change.

Provides memory health snapshots for a database engine instance. Each row represents a snapshot of recent memory usage that includes the severity of a memory health issue, if any.

For more information on troubleshooting insufficient memory in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], see [Troubleshoot out of memory errors in Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/troubleshoot-memory-errors-issues).

In Azure SQL Managed Instance, this view is available only on instances with the **always-up-to-date** update policy.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `snapshot_time` | datetime2, null | Snapshot time |
| `allocation_potential_memory_mb` | int, not null | Memory available to the database engine instance for new allocations, in megabytes. |
| `external_cache_mb` | int, not null | Memory used by reclaimable caches such as the buffer pool and the columnstore object pool, in megabytes. Under memory pressure, the database engine might shrink these caches to use the memory elsewhere. |
| `top_clerks` | nvarchar(4000), null | Top memory clerks by memory consumption, including memory usage statistics for each clerk. This information is provided as a JSON value. |
| `severity_level` | tinyint, not null | A value describing the severity of a memory health issue, one of:<br>1. LOW - No memory health issue is identified.<br>2. MEDIUM - There is medium confidence that a memory health issue might be present. Some attempts to allocate memory might fail. Data cache might be shrinking, and disk I/O can increase as the result.<br>3. HIGH - High confidence that a memory health issue is present. Available memory is likely insufficient, new memory allocation attempts can fail, and disk I/O can increase substantially because the size of the remaining data cache is too small. |

## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE [ssazuremi-md](../../includes/ssazuremi-md.md)], requires `VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Microsoft Entra admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerPerformanceStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE PERFORMANCE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerPerformanceStateReader##` server role is required.

## Remarks

A snapshot is added approximately every 15 seconds, for a total of up to 256 snapshots. Older snapshots are removed as newer snapshots are added. Data in this view is reset when the database engine restarts.

## Example

The following example returns memory health snapshots ordered by the most recent time.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_os_memory_health_history
ORDER BY snapshot_time DESC;
```
