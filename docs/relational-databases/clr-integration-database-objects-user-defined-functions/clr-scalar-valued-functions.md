# CLR scalar-valued functions

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

A scalar-valued function (SVF) returns a single value, such as a string, integer, or bit value. You can create scalar-valued user-defined functions in managed code using any [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] programming language. These functions are accessible to [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] or other managed code. For information about the advantages of common language runtime (CLR) integration and choosing between managed code and [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], see [CLR integration overview](../clr-integration/clr-integration-overview.md).

## Requirements for CLR scalar-valued functions

[!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SVFs are implemented as methods on a class in a [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assembly. The input parameters and the type returned from an SVF can be any of the scalar data types supported by [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], except **varchar**, **char**, **rowversion**, **text**, **ntext**, **image**, **timestamp**, **table**, or **cursor**. SVFs must ensure a match between the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data type and the return data type of the implementation method. For more information about type conversions, see [Map CLR parameter data](../clr-integration-database-objects-types-net-framework/mapping-clr-parameter-data.md).

When you implement a [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SVF in a [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] language, you can specify the `SqlFunction` custom attribute to include additional information about the function. The `SqlFunction` attribute indicates whether or not the function accesses or modifies data, if it's deterministic, and if the function involves floating point operations.

Scalar-valued user-defined functions might be deterministic or non-deterministic. A deterministic function always returns the same result when it's called with a specific set of input parameters. A non-deterministic function might return different results when it's called with a specific set of input parameters.

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't mark a function as deterministic if the function doesn't always produces the same output values, given the same input values and the same database state. Marking a function as deterministic, when the function isn't truly deterministic can result in corrupted indexed views and computed columns. You mark a function as deterministic by setting the `IsDeterministic` property to true.

### Table-valued parameters

Table-valued parameters (TVPs), user-defined table types that are passed into a procedure or function, provide an efficient way to pass multiple rows of data to the server. TVPs provide similar functionality to parameter arrays, but offer greater flexibility and closer integration with [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. They also provide the potential for better performance.

TVPs also help reduce the number of round trips to the server. Instead of sending multiple requests to the server, such as with a list of scalar parameters, data can be sent to the server as a TVP. A user-defined table type can't be passed as a table-valued parameter to, or be returned from, a managed stored procedure or function executing in the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process. For more information about TVPs, see [Use table-valued parameters (Database Engine)](../tables/use-table-valued-parameters-database-engine.md).

## Example of a CLR scalar-valued function

Here's a simple SVF that accesses data and returns an integer value:

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
using Microsoft.SqlServer.Server;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

public class T
{
    [SqlFunction(DataAccess = DataAccessKind.Read)]
    public static int ReturnOrderCount()
    {
        using (SqlConnection conn
            = new SqlConnection("context connection=true"))
        {
            conn.Open();
            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(
                "SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Order Count' FROM SalesOrderHeader", conn);
            return (int)cmd.ExecuteScalar();
        }
    }
}
```

### [Visual Basic .NET](#tab/vb)

```vb
Imports Microsoft.SqlServer.Server
Imports System.Data.SqlClient

Public Class T
    <SqlFunction(DataAccess:=DataAccessKind.Read)> _
    Public Shared Function ReturnOrderCount() As Integer
        Using conn As New SqlConnection("context connection=true")
            conn.Open()
            Dim cmd As New SqlCommand("SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Order Count' FROM SalesOrderHeader", conn)
            Return CType(cmd.ExecuteScalar(), Integer)
        End Using
    End Function
End Class
```

---

The first line of code references `Microsoft.SqlServer.Server` to access attributes and `System.Data.SqlClient` to access the ADO.NET namespace. (This namespace contains `SqlClient`, the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] Data Provider for [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].)

Next, the function receives the `SqlFunction` custom attribute, which is found in the `Microsoft.SqlServer.Server` namespace. The custom attribute indicates whether or not the user-defined function (UDF) uses the in-process provider to read data in the server. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] doesn't allow UDFs to update, insert, or delete data. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can optimize execution of a UDF that doesn't use the in-process provider. This is indicated by setting `DataAccessKind` to `DataAccessKind.None`. On the next line, the target method is a public static (shared in Visual Basic .NET).

The `SqlContext` class, located in the `Microsoft.SqlServer.Server` namespace, can then access a `SqlCommand` object with a connection to the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance that is already set up. Although not used here, the current transaction context is also available through the `System.Transactions` application programming interface (API).

Most of the lines of code in the function body should look familiar to developers who write client applications that use the types found in the `System.Data.SqlClient` namespace.

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

```sql
using(SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("context connection=true"))
{
   conn.Open();
   SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Order Count' FROM SalesOrderHeader", conn);
   return (int) cmd.ExecuteScalar();
}
```

### [Visual Basic .NET](#tab/vb)

```vb
Using conn As New SqlConnection("context connection=true")
   conn.Open()
   Dim cmd As New SqlCommand( _
        "SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Order Count' FROM SalesOrderHeader", conn)
   Return CType(cmd.ExecuteScalar(), Integer)
End Using
```

---

The appropriate command text is specified by initializing the `SqlCommand` object. The previous example counts the number of rows in table `SalesOrderHeader`. Next, the `ExecuteScalar` method of the `cmd` object is called. This returns a value of type **int** based on the query. Finally, the order count is returned to the caller.

If this code is saved in a file called FirstUdf.cs, it could be compiled into as assembly as follows:

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

```cmd
csc.exe /t:library /out:FirstUdf.dll FirstUdf.cs
```

### [Visual Basic .NET](#tab/vb)

```cmd
vbc.exe /t:library /out:FirstUdf.dll FirstUdf.vb
```

---

`/t:library` indicates that a library, rather than an executable, should be produced. Executables can't be registered in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

Visual C++ database objects compiled with `/clr:pure` aren't supported for execution on [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For example, such database objects include scalar-valued functions.

The [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query and a sample invocation to register the assembly and UDF are:

```sql
CREATE ASSEMBLY FirstUdf
    FROM 'FirstUdf.dll';
GO

CREATE FUNCTION CountSalesOrderHeader()
RETURNS INT
AS EXTERNAL NAME FirstUdf.T.ReturnOrderCount;
GO

SELECT dbo.CountSalesOrderHeader();
GO
```

The function name as exposed in [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] doesn't need to match the name of the target public static method.
