# CLR user-defined aggregates

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Traditionally, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supported only built-in aggregate functions, such as `SUM` or `MAX`, that operate on a set of input scalar values and generate a single aggregate value from that set. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] integration with the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR) now allows developers to create custom aggregate functions in managed code, and to make these functions accessible to [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] or other managed code.
