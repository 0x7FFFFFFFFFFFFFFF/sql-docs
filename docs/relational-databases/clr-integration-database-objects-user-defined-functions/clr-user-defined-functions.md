# CLR user-defined functions

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

User-defined functions are routines that can take parameters, perform calculations or other actions, and return a result. You can write user-defined functions in any .NET Framework programming language, such as [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET, to use on [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

There are two types of functions: *scalar*, which returns a single value, and *table-valued*, which returns a set of rows.
