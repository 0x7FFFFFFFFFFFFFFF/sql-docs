    [ , [ @refreshpolicy = ] refreshpolicy ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @publisher = ] N'*publisher*'

## Result set

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `publisher` | **sysname** | The name of a Publisher. |
| `distribution_db` | **sysname** | The name of the distribution database used by a given Publisher. |
| `status` | **int** | Maximum status of all replication agents associated with publications at this Publisher, which can be one of these values.<br /><br />`1` = Started<br />`2` = Succeeded<br />`3` = In progress<br />`4` = Idle<br />`5` = Retrying<br />`6` = Failed |
| `warning` | **int** | Maximum threshold warning generated by a subscription belonging to a publication at this Publisher, which can be the logical OR result of one or more of these values.<br /><br />`1` = expiration - a subscription to a transactional publication hasn't synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br />`2` = `latency` - the time taken to replicate data from a transactional Publisher to the Subscriber exceeds the threshold, in seconds.<br />`4` = `mergeexpiration` - a subscription to a merge publication hasn't synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br />`8` = `mergefastrunduration` - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a fast network connection.<br />`16` = `mergeslowrunduration` - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a slow network connection.<br />`32` = `mergefastrunspeed` - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a fast network connection.<br />`64` = `mergeslowrunspeed` - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a slow network connection. |
| `publicationcount` | **int** | The number of publications belonging to the Publisher. |
