# Spatial Data
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance Fabric SQL endpoint Fabric DW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

  Spatial data represents information about the physical location and shape of geometric objects. These objects can be point locations or more complex objects such as countries/regions, roads, or lakes.  
  
 [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports two spatial data types: the **geometry** data type and the **geography** data type.  
  
-   The **geometry** type represents data in a Euclidean (flat) coordinate system.  
  
-   The **geography** type represents data in a round-earth coordinate system.  
  
 Both data types are implemented as .NET common language runtime (CLR) data types in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Limitations

In [!INCLUDE [fabric-sqldb](../../includes/fabric-sqldb.md)], **geography** and **geometry** data types are supported but cannot be [mirrored to the Fabric OneLake](/fabric/database/sql/mirroring-overview).
