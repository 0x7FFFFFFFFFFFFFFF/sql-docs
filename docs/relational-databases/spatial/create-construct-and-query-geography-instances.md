# Create, Construct, and Query geography instances

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance Fabric SQL endpoint Fabric DW FabricSQLDB](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb.md)]  

  The geography spatial data type, **geography**, represents data in a round-earth coordinate system. This type is implemented as a .NET common language runtime (CLR) data type in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **geography** data type stores ellipsoidal (round-earth) data, such as GPS latitude and longitude coordinates.  
  
 The **geography** type is predefined and available in each database. You can create table columns of type **geography** and operate on **geography** data in the same manner as you would use other system-supplied types.

<a id="query"></a>

## Query the properties and behaviors of geography instances

 All **geography** instances have a number of properties that can be retrieved through methods that [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides. The following topics define the properties and behaviors of geography types, and the methods for querying each one.  
  
<a id="valid"></a>

### Validity, instance type, and GeometryCollection information
 After a **geography** instance is constructed, you can use the following methods to return the instance type, or if it is a **GeometryCollection** instance, return a specific **geography** instance.  
  
 **To return the instance type of a geography**  
 [STGeometryType (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stgeometrytype-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine if a geography is a given instance type**  
 [InstanceOf (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/instanceof-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine if a geography instance is well-formed for its instance type**  
 [STNumGeometries (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stnumgeometries-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return a specific geography in a GeometryCollection instance**  
 [STGeometryN (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stgeometryn-geography-data-type.md) STGeometryN (geography Data Type)  
  
<a id="number"></a>

### Number of points
 All nonempty **geography** instances are comprised of *points*. These points represent the latitude and longitude coordinates of the earth on which the **geography** instances are drawn. The data type **geography** provides numerous built-in methods for querying the points of an instance.  
  
 **To return the number of points that comprise an instance**  
 [STNumPoints (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stnumpoints-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return a specific point in an instance**  
 [STPointN (geometry Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geometry/stpointn-geometry-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return the start point of an instance**  
 [STStartPoint (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/ststartpoint-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return the endpoint of an instance**  
 [STEndPoint (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stendpoint-geography-data-type.md)  
  
<a id="dimension"></a>

### Dimension
 A nonempty **geography** instance can be 0-, 1-, or 2-dimensional. Zero-dimensional **geography** instances, such as **Point** and **MultiPoint**, have no length or area. One-dimensional objects, such as **LineString, CircularString**, **CompoundCurve**, and **MultiLineString**, have length. Two-dimensional instances, such as **Polygon, CurvePolygon**, and **MultiPolygon**, have area and length. Empty instances report a dimension of -1, and a **GeometryCollection** reports the maximum dimension of its contents.  
  
 **To return the dimension of an instance**  
 [STDimension (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stdimension-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return the length of an instance**  
 [STLength (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stlength-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return the area of an instance**  
 [STArea (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/starea-geography-data-type.md)  
  
<a id="empty"></a>

### Empty
 An _empty_**geography** instance does not have any points. The length of empty **LineString, CircularString**, **CompoundCurve**, and **MultiLineString** instances is 0. The area of empty **Polygon, CurvePolygon** and **MultiPolygon** instances is 0.  
  
 **To determine if an instance is empty**  
 [STIsEmpty (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stisempty-geography-data-type.md)  
  
<a id="closure"></a>

### Closure
 A _closed_**geography** instance is a figure whose start points and end points are the same. **Polygon** instances are considered closed. **Point** instances are not closed.  
  
 A ring is a simple, closed **LineString** instance.  
  
 **To determine if an instance is closed**  
 [STIsClosed (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stisclosed-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return the number of rings in a polygon instance**  
 [NumRings (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/numrings-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To return a specified ring of a geography instance**  
 [RingN (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/ringn-geography-data-type.md)  
  
<a id="srid"></a>

### Spatial reference ID (SRID)
 The spatial reference ID (SRID) is an identifier specifying which ellipsoidal coordinate system the **geography** instance is represented in. Two **geography** instances with different SRIDs cannot be compared.  
  
 **To set or return the SRID of an instance**  
 [STSrid (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stsrid-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 This property can be modified.  
  
<a id="rel"></a>

## Determining relationships between geography instances
 The **geography** data type provides many built-in methods you can use to determine relationships between two **geography** instances.  
  
 **To determine if two instances comprise the same point set**  
 [STEquals (geometry Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geometry/stequals-geometry-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine if two instances are disjoint**  
 [STDisjoint (geometry Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geometry/stdisjoint-geometry-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine if two instances intersect**  
 [STIntersects (geometry Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geometry/stintersects-geometry-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine the point or points where two instances intersect**  
 [STIntersection (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stintersection-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine the shortest distance between points in two geography instances**  
 [STDistance (geometry Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geometry/stdistance-geometry-data-type.md)  
  
 **To determine the difference in points between two geography instances**  
 [STDifference (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stdifference-geography-data-type.md)  
  
 **To derive the symmetric difference, or unique points, of one geography instance compared with another instance**  
 [STSymDifference (geography Data Type)](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stsymdifference-geography-data-type.md)  
  
<a id="supportedsrid"></a>

## geography instances must use supported SRID
 [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports SRIDs based on the EPSG standards. A [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-supported SRID for **geography** instances must be used when performing calculations or using methods with geography spatial data. The SRID must match one of the SRIDs displayed in the **sys.spatial_reference_systems** catalog view. As mentioned previously, when you perform calculations on your spatial data using the **geography** data type, your results will depend on which ellipsoid was used in the creation of your data, as each ellipsoid is assigned a specific spatial reference identifier (SRID).  
  
 [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses the default SRID of 4326, which maps to the WGS 84 spatial reference system, when using methods on **geography** instances. If you use data from a spatial reference system other than WGS 84 (or SRID 4326), you will need to determine the specific SRID for your geography spatial data.  

## Remarks

**Geometry** and **geography** types cannot be used as table columns in the [!INCLUDE [Fabric SQL analytics endpoint](../../includes/applies-to-version/_fabric-se.md)] or [!INCLUDE [Fabric Data Warehouse](../../includes/applies-to-version/_fabric-dw.md)].

## Examples
The following examples show how to add and query geography data.  

### Example A.
This example creates a table with an identity column and a `geography` column `GeogCol1`. A third column renders the `geography` column into its Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Well-Known Text (WKT) representation, and uses the `STAsText()` method. Two rows are then inserted: one row contains a `LineString` instance of `geography`, and one row contains a `Polygon` instance.  
  
```sql  
IF OBJECT_ID ( 'dbo.SpatialTable', 'U' ) IS NOT NULL   
DROP TABLE dbo.SpatialTable;  
GO  
  
CREATE TABLE SpatialTable   
  ( id int IDENTITY (1,1),  
    GeogCol1 geography,   
    GeogCol2 AS GeogCol1.STAsText()
   );  
GO  
  
INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeogCol1)  
VALUES (geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326));  
  
INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeogCol1)  
VALUES (geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))', 4326));  
GO  
```  
  
### Example B.
This example uses the `STIntersection()` method to return the points where the two previously inserted `geography` instances intersect.  
  
```sql  
DECLARE @geog1 geography;  
DECLARE @geog2 geography;  
DECLARE @result geography;  
  
SELECT @geog1 = GeogCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 1;  
SELECT @geog2 = GeogCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 2;  
SELECT @result = @geog1.STIntersection(@geog2);  
SELECT @result.STAsText();  
```
