# Access user-defined types in ADO.NET

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

User-defined types (UDTs) are written using any of the languages supported by the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR) that produce verifiable code. This includes [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET. UDTs allow objects and custom data structures to be stored in a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.

The data is exposed as public members of a .NET Framework class or structure, and behaviors are defined by methods of the class or structure. A UDT can be used as the column definition of a table, as a variable in a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] batch, or as an argument of a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] function or stored procedure.

In ADO.NET, the `System.Data.SqlClient` provider exposes UDTs in the following ways:

- Through the `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader` as an object.
- Through the `SqlDataReader` as raw bytes.
- As a parameter of a `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlParameter` object.
