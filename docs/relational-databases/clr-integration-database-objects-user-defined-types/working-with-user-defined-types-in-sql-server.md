# Work with user-defined types in SQL Server

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can access user-defined type (UDT) functionality in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from the [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] language by using regular query syntax. UDTs can be used in the definition of database objects, as variables in [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] batches, in functions and stored procedures, and as arguments in functions and stored procedures.
