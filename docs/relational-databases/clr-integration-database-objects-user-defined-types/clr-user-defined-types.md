# CLR user-defined types

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] gives you the ability to create database objects that are programmed against an assembly created in the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR). Database objects that can take advantage of the rich programming model provided by the CLR include triggers, stored procedures, functions, aggregate functions, and types.

> [!NOTE]  
> The ability to execute CLR code is set to OFF by default in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The CLR can be enabled by using the `sp_configure` system stored procedure.

You can use user-defined types (UDTs) to extend the scalar type system of the server, enabling storage of CLR objects in a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. UDTs can contain multiple elements and can have behaviors, differentiating them from the traditional alias data types which consist of a single [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system data type.

Because UDTs are accessed by the system as a whole, their use for complex data types might negatively affect performance. Complex data is generally best modeled using traditional rows and tables. UDTs in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are well suited to the following type of data:

- Date, time, currency, and extended numeric types
- Geospatial applications
- Encoded or encrypted data

The process of developing UDTs in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] consists of the following steps:

1. **Code and build the assembly that defines the UDT.** UDTs are defined using any of the languages supported by the [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR) that produce verifiable code. This includes [!INCLUDE [c-sharp-md](../../includes/c-sharp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [visual-basic-md](../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET. The data is exposed as fields and properties of a [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] class or structure, and behaviors are defined by methods of the class or structure.

1. **Register the assembly.** UDTs can be deployed through the Visual Studio user interface in a database project, or by using the [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] `CREATE ASSEMBLY` statement, which copies the assembly containing the class or structure into a database.

1. **Create the UDT in SQL Server.** Once an assembly is loaded into a host database, you use the [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] CREATE TYPE statement to create a UDT and expose the members of the class or structure as members of the UDT. UDTs exist only in the context of a single database, and, once registered, have no dependencies on the external files from which they were created.

1. **Create tables, variables, or parameters using the UDT.** A user-defined type can be used as the column definition of a table, as a variable in a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] batch, or as an argument of a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] function or stored procedure.
