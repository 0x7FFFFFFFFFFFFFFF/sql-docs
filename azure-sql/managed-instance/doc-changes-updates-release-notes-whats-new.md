## November 2022 feature wave

Changes and capabilities that were introduced in the November 2022 feature wave have been integrated to the majority of instances and are now available by default. Since taking separate action to enroll an instance is no longer necessary, options that mention the November 2022 feature wave have been removed from the Azure portal for instances that have enrolled in the feature wave. The last remaining instances are currently in the enrollment process. 

All new instances on production subscriptions are enrolled in the feature wave by default if they are created in eligible subnets. The following subnet types are eligible:

- Newly created subnet (default)
- Existing subnets that are empty
- Existing subnets that already have the feature wave enabled, and contain only instances **with** the feature wave enabled
- Existing subnets that don't have the feature wave enabled, and contain only instances **without** the feature wave

The benefits in the feature wave include:

- [**Fast instance provisioning**](management-operations-overview.md#fast-provisioning) -  It takes less time to deploy an instance.
- [**Improved network security**](connectivity-architecture-overview.md) - Internal service traffic is now isolated and secured by Microsoft. 
- [**Enhanced virtual cluster**](virtual-cluster-architecture.md) -  The functionality of the underlying virtual cluster is enhanced.

The features available in the wave are:

- [Instance stop/start](instance-stop-start-how-to.md): You can start and stop your instance at your discretion to save on billing costs for vCores and SQL Server licensing.
- [Zone redundancy for Business Critical tier](..//managed-instance/high-availability-sla.md): You can deploy your Business Critical tier managed instance across multiple availability zones to improve the availability of your service.
- [Managed DTC](distributed-transaction-coordinator-dtc.md): Run distributed transactions in mixed environments.
