# Save on compute costs with Azure Reservations - Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance
[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)] 

This article provides an overview of using Azure Reservations to save on compute costs for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. Azure Reservations are a billing discount that you can use to save money by committing to use compute resources at a discounted rate for a period of time. 

> [!NOTE]
> Purchasing a reservation is a cost-saving mechanism that reserves a discounted price for compute resources, and does not pre-allocate or guarantee specific infrastructure resources (virtual machines or nodes) for use. 

## What are Azure Reservations?

With Azure Reservations, you commit to using Azure SQL resource for a period of one or three years to receive a significant discount on compute costs. To purchase a reservation, you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.

You do not need to assign the reservation to a specific database or managed instance. Matching existing deployments that are already running, or ones that are newly deployed automatically, get the benefit. Hence, by purchasing a reservation, existing resources infrastructure would not be modified and thus no failover/downtime is triggered on existing resources. By purchasing a reservation, you commit to usage for the compute costs for a period of one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the compute charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you-go rates.

A reservation applies to both primary and billable secondary compute replicas, but does not cover software, networking, or storage charges associated with the service. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires and the database or managed instance is billed at the pay-as-you-go price. Reservations do not automatically renew. For pricing information, see the [reservation offering](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/managed/).

You can buy reservations in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Pay for the reservation [up front or with monthly payments](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/prepare-buy-reservation). 

To buy a reservation:

- You must have the `Owner` role or `Reservation Purchaser` role on an Azure subscription.
- For Enterprise subscriptions, **Add Reserved Instances** must be enabled in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com). Or, if that setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin on the subscription. 

For more information about how enterprise customers and pay-as-you-go customers are charged for reservation purchases, see [Understand Azure reservation usage for your Enterprise enrollment](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea) and [Understand Azure reservation usage for your pay-as-you-go subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage).

> [!NOTE] 
> You can significantly save on Azure SQL Managed Instance costs by applying your reservations to an [instance pool](../managed-instance/instance-pools-overview.md#reservations-pricing).

## Determine the correct size before purchase

The size of reservation should be based on the total amount of compute used by the existing or soon-to-be-deployed database or managed instance within a specific region and using the same performance tier and hardware configuration.

For example, let's suppose that you are running:
- 1 General Purpose, standard-series (Gen5) – 16 vCore elastic pool and 
- 2 Business Critical standard-series (Gen5) – 4 vCore single databases. 

Further, let's suppose that you plan to deploy the following within the next month: 
- 1 additional General Purpose standard-series (Gen5) – 16 vCore elastic pool and 
- 1 business critical standard-series (Gen5) – 32 vCore elastic pool. 

Also, let's suppose that you know that you will need these resources for at least 1 year. In this case, you should purchase a 32 (2x16) vCores 1-year reservation for single database/elastic pool General Purpose - standard-series (Gen5) and a 40 (2x4 + 32) vCore 1-year reservation for single database/elastic pool Business Critical - standard-series (Gen5).

## Reservations for zone-redundant SQL managed instances

When you enable [zone-redundancy](../managed-instance/high-availability-sla-local-zone-redundancy.md#zone-redundant-availability) for Azure SQL Managed Instance, resources are made available in multiple availability zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance. 

_Regular compute resources_ for the primary instance are charged separately to the _zone-redundant add-on_, and both are listed as separate entries on your bill. 

Total compute is calculated by adding the _zone-redundant add-on_ to the _regular compute cost_. While it's possible to pay for reservations for only the regular compute cost, or the zone redundant add-on, to achieve full reservation coverage for zone-redundant instances, you must purchase two separate reservations.

The following lists the compute charges for different reservation scenarios:
- **No reservation**:   
   `Regular price for regular compute` + `regular price for zone-redundant add-on`
- **Full reservation**:   
   `Discounted reservation for regular compute` + `discounted reservation for zone-redundant add-on`
- **Reservation for only regular compute**:   
   `Discounted reservation for regular compute` + `regular price for zone-redundant add-on`
- **Reservation for only zone-redundant add-on**:   
   `Regular price for regular compute` + `discounted reservation for zone-redundant add-on`

Carefully evaluate your compute needs and reservation strategy to optimize costs and ensure efficient resource allocation.

## Buy reservations

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **All services** > **Reservations**.
1. Select **Add** and then in the **Purchase Reservations** pane, 
    - Select **SQL Database** to purchase a new reservation for Azure SQL Database.
    - Select **SQL Managed Instance** to purchase a new reservation for Azure SQL Managed Instance.
1. Fill in the required fields. Existing databases in SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance that match the attributes you select qualify to get the reservation discount. The actual number of databases or managed instances that get the discount depends on the scope and quantity selected.

    The following table describes the required fields.
    
    | Field      | Description|
    |------------|--------------|
    |Subscription|The subscription used to pay for the reservation. The payment method on the subscription is charged the upfront costs for the reservation. The subscription type must be an enterprise agreement (offer number MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P) or an individual agreement with pay-as-you-go pricing (offer number MS-AZR-0003P or MS-AZR-0023P). For an enterprise subscription, the charges are deducted from the enrollment's Azure Prepayment (previously called monetary commitment) balance or charged as overage. For an individual subscription with pay-as-you-go pricing, the charges are billed to the credit card or invoice payment method on the subscription.|
    |Scope       |The vCore reservation's scope can cover one subscription or multiple subscriptions (shared scope). If you select <br/><br/>**Shared**, the vCore reservation discount is applied to the database or managed instance running in any subscriptions within your billing context. For enterprise customers, the shared scope is the enrollment and includes all subscriptions within the enrollment. For pay-as-you-go customers, the shared scope is all pay-as-you-go subscriptions created by the account administrator.<br/><br/>**Single subscription**, the vCore reservation discount is applied to the databases or managed instances in this subscription. <br/><br/>**Single resource group**, the reservation discount is applied to the instances of databases or managed instances in the selected subscription and the selected resource group within that subscription.</br></br>**Management group**, the reservation discount is applied to the matching resource in the list of subscriptions that are a part of both the management group and billing scope.|
    |Region      |The Azure region that's covered by the reservation.|
    |Deployment Type|The SQL resource type that you want to buy the reservation for.|
    |Performance Tier|The service tier for the databases or managed instances. |
    |Term        |One year or three years.|
    |Quantity    |The number of vCores in the selected Azure region and service tier covered by the reservation. For example, if you run, or plan to run, multiple databases with a total compute capacity of standard-series (Gen5) 16 vCores in the East US region, then specify the quantity as 16 vCores to maximize the benefit for all the databases. |

1. Review the cost of the reservation in the **Costs** section.
1. Select **Purchase**.
1. Select **View this Reservation** to see the status of your purchase.

## Cancel, exchange, or refund reservations

You can cancel, exchange, or refund reservations with certain limitations. For more information, see [Self-service exchanges and refunds for Azure Reservations](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations).

## vCore size flexibility

vCore size flexibility helps you scale up or down within a performance tier and region, without losing the reservation benefit. Reservations also provides you with the flexibility to temporarily move your hot databases in and out of elastic pools (within the same region and performance tier) as part of your normal operations without losing the reservation benefit. By keeping an unapplied buffer in your reservation, you can effectively manage the performance spikes without exceeding your budget.

## Limitation

You cannot reserve DTU-based (basic, standard, or premium) databases in SQL Database. Reservation pricing is only supported for features and products that are in General Availability state.
