### Obtain the connection string from the Azure portal

Use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to obtain the connection string that's necessary for your client program to interact with Azure SQL Database.

1. Select **All services** > **SQL databases**.

1. Enter the name of your database into the filter text box near the upper left of the **SQL databases** pane.

1. Select the row for your database.

1. After the pane appears for your database, for visual convenience select the **Minimize** buttons to collapse the blades you used for browsing and database filtering.

1. On the pane for your database, select **Show database connection strings**.

1. Copy the appropriate connection string. For example, if you intend to use the ADO.NET connection library, copy the appropriate string from the **ADO.NET** tab.

1. Edit the connection string as needed. In this example, insert your password into the connection string, or remove `<server-name>` from the username if the username or server name are too long.

1. In one format or another, paste the connection string information into your client program code.
