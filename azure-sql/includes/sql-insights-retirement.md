> [!IMPORTANT]
> SQL Insights (preview) will be retired on 31 December 2024. We recommend that you transition to [database watcher for Azure SQL (preview)](../database-watcher-overview.md) or another database monitoring solution by that date.
>
> Database watcher is the recommended monitoring solution for scenarios that require low data collection latency, estate-level monitoring, comprehensive monitoring data including query-level details, and support for advanced analytics on collected monitoring data. At this time, database watcher supports Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance.
>
> After 31 December 2024, SQL Insights (preview) will not be supported and will not be available in the Azure portal. You will retain any existing monitoring data collected by SQL Insights in your Log Analytics workspace.
